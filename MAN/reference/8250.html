	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  2F9, 3F9: Interrupt Enable Register
	 | | | | | | | `---- 1 = enable data available int (and 16550 Timeout)
	 | | | | | | `----- 1 = enable THRE interrupt
	 | | | | | `------ 1 = enable lines status interrupt
	 | | | | `------- 1 = enable modem-status-change interrupt
	 `-------------- reserved (zero)

	- 16550 will interrupt if data exists in the FIFO and isn't read
	  within the time it takes to receive four bytes or if no data is
	  received within the time it takes to receive four bytes.

	- Baud rate divisors can be calculated by taking the oscillating
	  frequency (1,843,200) and dividing by the quantity of the desired
	  baud rate times the UART clocking factor (16).  Use the following
	  formula:

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Port 3FA - Interrupt Identification Register - IIR  (read only)</H2>

<PRE>

	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  2FA, 3FA Interrupt ID Register
	 | | | | | | | `---- 1 = no int. pending, 0=int. pending
	 | | | | | `------- Interrupt Id bits (see below)
	 | | | | `-------- 16550  1 = timeout int. pending, 0 for 8250/16450
	 | | `----------- reserved (zero)
	 `-------------- 16550	set to 1 if FIFO queues are enabled

<B>	Bits</B>

	- interrupt pending flag uses reverse logic, 0 = pending, 1 = none
	- interrupt will occur if any of the line status bits are set
	- THRE bit is set when THRE register is emptied into the TSR

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Port 3FA - 16550 FIFO Control Register - FCR  (write only)</H2>

<PRE>

	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  2FA, 3FA  FIFO Control Register
	 | | | | | | | `---- 1 = enable clear XMIT and RCVR FIFO queues
	 | | | | | | `----- 1 = clear RCVR FIFO
	 | | | | | `------ 1 = clear XMIT FIFO
	 | | | | `------- 1 = change RXRDY & TXRDY pins from mode 0 to mode 1
	 | | `---------- reserved (zero)
	 `------------- trigger level for RCVR FIFO interrupt

<B>	Bits	  RCVR FIFO</B>
<B>	 76	Trigger Level</B>
	 00	   1 byte
	 01	   4 bytes
	 10	   8 bytes
	 11	  14 bytes

	- Bit 0 must be set in order to write to other FCR bits
	- Bit 1 when set to 1 the RCVR FIFO is cleared and this bit is reset.
	  The receiver shift register is not cleared.
	- Bit 2 when set to 1 the XMIT FIFO is cleared and this bit is reset.
	  The transmit shift register is not cleared.

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Port 3FB - Line Control Register - LCR  (read/write)</H2>

<PRE>

	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  2FB, 3FB  Line Control Register
	 | | | | | | `------ word length select bits (see below)
	 | | | | | `------- 0 = 1 stop bit, 1 = 1.5 or 2  (see note)
	 | | | | `-------- 0 = no parity, 1 = parity (PEN)
	 | | | `--------- 0 = odd parity, 1 = even (EPS)
	 | | `---------- 0 = parity disabled, 1 = enabled
	 | `----------- 0 = turn break off, 1 = force spacing break state
	 `------------ 1 = baud rate divisor (DLAB); 0 = RBR, THR or IER

<B>	Bits</B>
<B>	 10	Word length bits</B>
	 00 = 5 bits per character
	 01 = 6 bits per character
	 10 = 7 bits per character
	 11 = 8 bits per character

	- stop bits = 1.5 for 5 bit words or 2 for 6, 7 or 8 bit words
	- bit 7 changes the mode of registers 3F8 and 3F9.  If set these
	  registers become the LSB and MSB of the baud rate divisor.
	  Otherwise 3F8 is the Transmit/Receive Buffer Register and 3F9 is
	  the Interrupt Enable Register.

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Port 3FC - Modem Control Register - MCR  (read/write)</H2>

<PRE>

	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  2FC, 3FC  Modem Control Register
	 | | | | | | | `---- 1 = activate DTR
	 | | | | | | `----- 1 = activate RTS
	 | | | | | `------ OUT1
	 | | | | `------- OUT2
	 | | | `-------- 0 = normal, 1 = loop back test
	 `------------- reserved (zero)

	- If bit 4 is set, data from the Transmit Shift Register is received
	  in the Receiver Shift Register.  The SOUT line is set to logic
	  high, the SIN line and control lines are disconnected.   CTS, DSR,
	  RI and CD inputs are disconnected.  DTR, RTS, OUT1 and OUT2 are
	  then connected internally.


</PRE>

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Port 3FD - Line Status Register - LSR	(read only)</H2>

<PRE>

	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  2FD, 3FD Line Status Register
	 | | | | | | | `---- 1 = data ready
	 | | | | | | `----- 1 = overrun error (OE)
	 | | | | | `------ 1 = parity error (PE)
	 | | | | `------- 1 = framing error (FE)
	 | | | `-------- 1 = break interrupt  (BI)
	 | | `--------- 1 = transmitter holding register empty (THRE)
	 | `---------- 1 = transmitter shift register empty (TSRE)
	 `----------- 1 = 16550 PE/FE/Break in FIFO queue, 0 for 8250 & 16450

	- Bit 0 is set when a byte is placed in the Receiver Buffer Register
	  and cleared when the byte is read by the CPU (or when the CPU
	  clears the FIFO for the 16550).  Results in Receive Data Available
	  Interrupts if enabled.
	- Bits 1-4 indicate errors and result in Line Status Interrupts
	  if enabled.
	- Bit 1 is set when a second byte is received before the byte
	  in the Receiver Buffer Register is read by the CPU (the 16550 in
	  FIFO mode sets this bit when the queue is full and the byte in the
	  Receiver Shift Register hasn't been moved into the queue).  This
	  bit is reset when the CPU reads the LSR
	- Bit 2 is set whenever a byte is received that doesn't match the
	  requested parity.  Reset upon reading the LSR.  (The 16550 maintains
	  parity information with each byte and sets bit 2 only when the byte
	  is at the top of the FIFO queue.)
	- Bit 3 is set when a character is received without proper stop
	  bits.  Upon detecting a framing error the UART attempts to
	  resynchronize.  Reset by reading the LSR.  (The 16550 maintains
	  this information with each byte and sets bit 3 only when the byte
	  is at the top of the FIFO queue.)
	- Bit 4 is set when a break condition is sensed (when space is
	  detected for longer than 1 fullword).  A zero byte is placed in
	  the Receiver Buffer Register (or 16550 FIFO).  Reset by reading
	  the LSR.  (The 16550 maintains this information with each byte and
	  sets bit 4 only when the byte is at the top of the FIFO queue.)
	- Bit 5 is set when the Transmit Holding Register shifts a byte
	  into the Transmit Shift Register (or XMIT FIFO queue is empty for
	  16550) and is cleared when a byte is written to the THR (or the
	  XMIT FIFO).	Results in Transmit Holding Register Empty interrupts
	  if enabled.
	- Bit 6 is set when both the Transmitter Holding Register and the
	  Transmitter Shift Register are empty. On the 16550, when the XMIT
	  FIFO and Transmitter Shift Register are empty.
	- Bit 7 is 16550 specific and indicates there is a byte in the FIFO
	  queue that was received with a Parity, Framing or Break error.

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Port 3FE - Modem Status Register - MSR (read only)</H2>

<PRE>

	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  2FE, 3FE Modem Status Register
	 | | | | | | | `---- 1 = DCTS  Delta CTS  (CTS changed) 
	 | | | | | | `----- 1 = DDSR  Delta DSR  (DSR changed)
	 | | | | | `------ 1 = RI ring indicator changed
	 | | | | `------- 1 = DDCD  Delta Data Carrier Detect (DCD changed)
	 | | | `-------- 1 = CTS
	 | | `--------- 1 = DSR
	 | `---------- 1 = ring indicator (RI)
	 `----------- 1 = receive line signal detect

	- Bits 0-3 are reset when the CPU reads the MSR
	- Bit 4 is the Modem Control Register RTS during loopback test
	- Bit 5 is the Modem Control Register DTR during loopback test
	- Bit 6 is the Modem Control Register OUT1 during loopback test
	- Bit 7 is the Modem Control Register OUT2 during loopback test

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Port 3FF/2FF - Scratch Pad Register  (read/write)</H2>

<PRE>

<B>	Programming considerations:</B>
	- 8250's, 16450's are essentially identical to program
	- 16550's is pin and software compatible with the 16450 but has an
	  internal FIFO queue that may be enabled/disabled by software
	- PCs are capable of 38.4Kb, while AT's are capable of 115.2Kb
	- receiver checks only the first stop bit of each character regardless
	  of the number of stop bits specified
	- Older 8250 and 16450 UARTs may lose THRE interrupt if the THRE and
	  Receive Data (RD) or the Line Status (LS) interrupts occur
	  simultaneously during a full duplex transmission.  RD and LS have
	  higher priority than THRE which causes the lower priority interrupt
	  to be lost.  The following are 3 methods used to avoid this problem:
	 
	  1. Disable/re-enable THRE interrupt via the IER after processing
	     Receive Data & Line Status interrupts.
	  2. While inside the RD and LS interrupt routines check the LSR
	     THRE bit and set a flag that a THRE interrupt was waiting.
	  3. Poll the LSR THRE bit instead of using the IRR.
	  
	- data loss can occur without overrun or framing errors if the
	  interrupts are serviced too slowly
	- reserved bits are usually set to zero.  Code should NOT rely on
	  this being the case since future enhancement may use these bits
	- see  <A HREF="int_table.html">INT TABLE</A>  or  <A HREF="int_table.html">IRQ</A>  for interrupt assignments
	- see  <A HREF="ports.html">PORTS</A>   for COMx port assignment (3F8,2F8,3E8,2E8,3220...)
