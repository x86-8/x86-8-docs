<B>	Other Registers</B>

	IRR - Interrupt Request Register, maintains a bit vector indicating
	      which IRQ hardware events are awaiting service.	Highest
	      level interrupt is reset when the CPU acknowledges interrupt.
	ISR - In Service Register, tracks IRQ line currently being serviced.
	      Updated by EOI command.

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Hardware Interrupt Sequence of Events:</H2>

<PRE>

	1. 8259 <A HREF="int_table.html">IRQ</A> signal is raised high by hardware setting the
	   corresponding IRR bits true.

	2. PIC evaluates the interrupt requests and signals the CPU
	   where appropriate.

	3. CPU acknowledges the INT by pulsing INTA (inverted)

	4. INTA signal from CPU is received by the PIC, which then sets the
	   highest priority ISR bit, and clears the corresponding IRR bit

	5. CPU sends a second INTA pulse which causes the PIC to send the
	   interrupt ID byte onto the bus.  CPU begins interrupt processing.

	6. Interrupts of lower and equal priority are blocked until a
	   Non-Specific EOI (20h) is sent to the command port.

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Initialization Procedure</H2>

<PRE>

<B>	Initialization</B>
	 1. write ICW1 to port 20h
	 2. write ICW2 to port 21h
	 3. if ICW1 bit D1=1  do nothing
	    if ICW1 bit D1=0  write ICW3 to port 20h
	 4. write ICW4 to port 21h
	 5. OCW's can follow in any order

<H2 ALIGN=Center>8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller Notes</H2>

<PRE>

	- Operation Command Word (OCW), commands that set the 8259 in
	  various interrupt modes.  These can be written to the 8259
	  anytime after initialization.
	- The 8259 differentiates between the OCW1, OCW2 and OCW3 by the
	  port address and the value of the data bits D4 and D3.  ICW2
	  through ICW4 are order related and must follow ICW1.	ICW1 is
	  identified by an even port number and data bit D4 set to 1.
	- PCs operate in fully nested mode, where a Non-Specific EOI resets
	  the interrupt identified by the highest bit value in the ISR
	- 8259s can be chained together where the INT pin (output) of a
	  slave 8259 can be used as the input to an IRQ line allowing up
	  to 64 priority vectored interrupts.  AT level machines use two
	  8259's for a total of 16 hardware interrupt levels
	- the first 8259 ports are located at 20h and 21h
	- the second 8259 ports are located at A0h and A1h
	- PC and AT interrupts are Edge Triggered while PS/2's are Level
	  Triggered
	- some ASIC chips designed for Tandy 1000 Systems malfunction if
	  specific and non-specific EOIs are mixed
	- for a more in-depth discussion of the 8259, see Intel's "Micro-
	  processor and Peripherals Handbook, Volume I"
