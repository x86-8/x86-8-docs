<H2 ALIGN=Center>OUT - Output Data to Port</H2>

<PRE>


	Usage:	OUT	port,accum
	Modifies flags: None

	Transfers byte in AL,word in AX or dword in EAX to the specified
	hardware port address.  If the port number is in the range of 0-255
	it can be specified as an immediate.  If greater than 255 then the
	port number must be specified in DX.  Since the PC only decodes 10
	bits of the port address, values over 1023 can only be decoded by
	third party vendor equipment and also map to the port range 0-1023.

	- 386+ protected mode timings depend on privilege levels.

	  first number is the timing when:    CPL ó IOPL
	  second number is the timing when:   CPL > IOPL
	  third number is the timing when:    virtual mode on 486 processor
