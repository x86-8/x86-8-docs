<H2 ALIGN=Center>8253/8254 PIT - Programmable Interval Timer</H2>

<PRE>

	Port 40h, 8253 Counter 0 Time of Day Clock (normally mode 3)
	Port 41h, 8253 Counter 1 RAM Refresh Counter (normally mode 2)
	Port 42h, 8253 Counter 2 Cassette and Speaker Functions
	Port 43h, 8253 Mode Control Register, data format:

	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  Mode Control Register
	 | | | | | | | `---- 0=16 binary counter, 1=4 decade BCD counter
	 | | | | `--------- counter mode bits
	 | | `------------ read/write/latch format bits
	 `--------------- counter select bits (also 8254 read back command)

<B>	Bits</B>
<B>	 76 Counter Select Bits</B>
	 00  select counter 0
	 01  select counter 1
	 10  select counter 2
	 11  read back command (8254 only, illegal on 8253, see below)

<B>	Bits</B>
<B>	 54  Read/Write/Latch Format Bits</B>
	 00  latch present counter value
	 01  read/write of MSB only
	 10  read/write of LSB only
	 11  read/write LSB, followed by write of MSB

<B>	Bits</B>
<B>	321  Counter Mode Bits</B>
	000  mode 0, interrupt on terminal count;  countdown, interrupt,
	     then wait for a new mode or count; loading a new count in the
	     middle of a count stops the countdown
	001  mode 1, programmable one-shot; countdown with optional
	     restart; reloading the counter will not affect the countdown
	     until after the following trigger
	010  mode 2, rate generator; generate one pulse after 'count' CLK
	     cycles; output remains high until after the new countdown has
	     begun; reloading the count mid-period does not take affect
	     until after the period
	011  mode 3, square wave rate generator; generate one pulse after
	     'count' CLK cycles; output remains high until 1/2 of the next
	     countdown; it does this by decrementing by 2 until zero, at
	     which time it lowers the output signal, reloads the counter
	     and counts down again until interrupting at 0; reloading the
	     count mid-period does not take affect until after the period
	100  mode 4, software triggered strobe; countdown with output high
	     until counter zero;  at zero output goes low for one CLK
	     period;  countdown is triggered by loading counter;  reloading
	     counter takes effect on next CLK pulse
	101  mode 5, hardware triggered strobe; countdown after triggering
	     with output high until counter zero; at zero output goes low
	     for one CLK period

<B>	Read Back Command Format  (8254 only)</B>

	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0| Read Back Command (written to Mode Control Reg)
	 | | | | | | | `--- must be zero
	 | | | | | | `---- select counter 0
	 | | | | | `----- select counter 1
	 | | | | `------ select counter 2
	 | | | `------- 0 = latch status of selected counters
	 | | `-------- 0 = latch count of selected counters
	 `----------- 11 = read back command

<B>	Read Back Command Status (8254 only, read from counter register)</B>

	|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  Read Back Command Status
	 | | | | | | | `--- 0=16 binary counter, 1=4 decade BCD counter
	 | | | | `-------- counter mode bits (see Mode Control Reg above)
	 | | `----------- read/write/latch format (see Mode Control Reg)
	 | `------------ 1=null count (no count set), 0=count available
	 `------------- state of OUT pin (1=high, 0=low)


	- the 8253 is used on the PC & XT, while the 8254 is used on the AT+
	- all counters are decrementing and fully independent
	- the PIT is tied to 3 clock lines all generating 1.19318 MHz.
	- the value of 1.19318MHz is derived from (4.77/4 MHz) and has it's
	  roots based on NTSC frequencies
	- counters are 16 bit quantities which are decremented and then
	  tested against zero.	Valid range is (0-65535).  To get a value
	  of 65536 clocks you must specify 0 as the default count since
	  65536 is a 17 bit value.
	- reading by latching the count doesn't disturb the countdown but
	  reading the port directly does; except when using the 8254 Read
	  Back Command
	- counter 0 is the time of day interrupt and is generated
	  approximately 18.2 times per sec.  The value 18.2 is derived from
	  the frequency 1.10318/65536 (the normal default count).
	- counter 1 is normally set to 18 (dec.) and signals the 8237 to do
	  a RAM refresh approximately every 15æs
	- counter 2 is normally used to generate tones from the speaker
	  but can be used as a regular counter when used in conjunction
	  with the 8255
	- newly loaded counters don't take effect until after a an output
	  pulse or input CLK cycle depending on the mode
	- the 8253 has a max input clock rate of 2.6MHz, the 8254 has max
	  input clock rate of 10MHz

<B>	Programming considerations:</B>

	  1.  load Mode Control Register
	  2.  let bus settle (jmp $+2)
	  3.  write counter value
	  4.  if counter 0 is modified, an INT 8 handler must be written to
	      call the original INT 8 handler every 18.2 seconds.  When it
	      does call the original INT 8 handler it must NOT send and EOI
	      to the <A HREF="8259.html">8259</A> for the timer interrupt, since the original INT 8
	      handler will send the EOI also.

<B>	Example code:</B>

	countdown  equ	8000h ; approx 36 interrupts per second

	   cli
	   mov	al,00110110b  ; bit 7,6 = (00) timer counter 0
			      ; bit 5,4 = (11) write LSB then MSB
			      ; bit 3-1 = (011) generate square wave
			      ; bit 0 = (0) binary counter
	   out	43h,al	      ; prep PIT, counter 0, square wave&init count
	   jmp	$+2
	   mov	cx,countdown  ; default is 0x0000 (65536) (18.2 per sec)
			      ; interrupts when counter decrements to 0
	   mov	al,cl	      ; send LSB of timer count
	   out	40h,al
	   jmp	$+2
	   mov	al,ch	      ; send MSB of timer count
	   out	40h,al
	   jmp	$+2
