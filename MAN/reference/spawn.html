	int spawnl( int mode, char *path, char *arg0,
			char *arg1, ..., NULL )
	int spawnle( int mode, char *path, char *arg0,
			char *arg1, ..., NULL, char *envp[] )
	int spawnlp( int mode, char *path, char *arg0,
			char *arg1, ..., NULL )
	int spawnlpe( int mode, char *path, char *arg0,
			char *arg1, ..., NULL, char *envp[] )
	int spawnv( int mode, char *path, char *argv )
	int spawnve( int mode, char *path, char *argv, char *envp[] )
	int spawnvp( int mode, char *path, char *argv )
	int spawnvpe( int mode, char *path, char *argv, char *envp[] )

	- prototype in process.h

	- creates & runs child processes
	- mode is P_WAIT which puts parent process "on hold" until child
	  completes execution; P_NOWAIT which continues to run parent
	  while child runs (not supported yet); or P_OVERLAY which overlays
	  child in memory location formerly occupied by parent (same as
	  exec... call)
	- use P_WAIT to perform a DOS shell
	- returns 0 for SUCCESS and non-zero for failure based on the
	  errorlevel set by the application

	- see	<A HREF="exec___.html">exec...</A>
