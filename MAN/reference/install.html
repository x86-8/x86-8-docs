<H2 ALIGN=Center>INSTALL/SETUP - HELPPC Installation</H2>

<PRE>

	Installation requires two steps.  First, simply decompress the
	HelpPC archive file.  Second, issue the following command:

	SET HLP=d:dirname     (no blanks, except between "SET HLP")

	Where 'd:' is the drive and 'dirname' is the directory where
	the HelpPC.NDX and the .TXT files will reside (should be fully
	qualified, with or without the trailing backslash '\', see
	example below).  HelpPC.COM can exist anywhere it can be
	accessed through the DOS command search path (PATH).  The
	"SET HLP=" command should be placed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
	to allow easy access to the database each time your PC is
	rebooted.  It is recommended that HelpPC.COM be renamed to
	something quick and comfortable to use, like  H.COM or HELP.COM.


	As an example, if the files HelpPC.NDX and the .TXT files
	reside in a directory named  C:\HELPPC  then use:

<B>	SET HLP=C:\HELPPC	or     SET HLP=C:\HELPPC\</B>
