<PRE>


	Usage:	INS	dest,port
		INSB
		INSW
		INSD  (386+ only)
	Modifies flags: None

	Loads data from port to the destination ES:(E)DI  (even if a
	destination operand is supplied).  (E)DI is adjusted by the size
	of the operand and increased if the Direction Flag is cleared and
	decreased if the Direction Flag is set.  For INSB, INSW, INSD no
	operands are allowed and the size is determined by the mnemonic.
