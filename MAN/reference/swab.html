<H2 ALIGN=Center>void swab( char *src, char *dest, int nbytes )</H2>

<PRE>


	- prototype in stdlib.h

	- copies nbytes bytes from src into dest, with adjacent even and
	  odd-byte positions being swapped
	- nbytes should therefore be an even number
	- a standard way of performing this is to use the <A HREF="xchg.html">XCHG</A> instruction
