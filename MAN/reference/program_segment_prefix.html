<B>     Offset Size	      Description</B>

	00   word	machine code <A HREF="int_20.html">INT 20</A> instruction (CDh 20h)
	02   word	top of memory in segment (paragraph) form
	04   byte	reserved for DOS, usually 0
	05  5bytes	machine code instruction long call to the DOS
			function dispatcher (obsolete CP/M)
	06   word	.COM programs bytes available in segment (CP/M)
	0A   dword	<A HREF="int_22.html">INT 22</A> terminate address;  DOS loader jumps to this
			address upon exit;  the EXEC function forces a child
			process to return to the parent by setting this
			vector to code within the parent (IP,CS)
	0E   dword	<A HREF="int_23.html">INT 23</A> Ctrl-Break exit address; the original INT 23
			vector is NOT restored from this pointer (IP,CS)
	12   dword	<A HREF="int_24.html">INT 24</A> critical error exit address; the original
			INT 24 vector is NOT restored from this field (IP,CS)
	16   word	parent process segment addr (Undoc. DOS 2.x+)
			COMMAND.COM has a parent id of zero, or its own PSP
	18  20bytes	file handle array (Undocumented DOS 2.x+); if handle
			array element is FF then handle is available.  Network
			redirectors often indicate remotes files by setting
			these to values between 80-FE.
	2C   word	segment address of the environment, or zero (DOS 2.x+)
	2E   dword	SS:SP on entry to last INT 21 function (Undoc. 2.x+) Ø
	32   word	handle array size (Undocumented DOS 3.x+)
	34   dword	handle array pointer (Undocumented DOS 3.x+)
	38   dword	pointer to previous PSP (deflt FFFF:FFFF, Undoc 3.x+) Ø
	3C  20bytes	unused in DOS before 4.01  Ø
	50   3bytes	DOS function dispatcher CDh 21h CBh (Undoc. 3.x+) Ø
	53   9bytes	unused
	5C  36bytes	default unopened <A HREF="fcb.html">FCB</A> #1 (parts overlayed by FCB #2)
	6C  20bytes	default unopened FCB #2 (overlays part of FCB #1)
	80   byte	count of characters in command tail;  all bytes
			following command name;  also default <A HREF="dta.html">DTA</A> (128 bytes)
	81 127bytes	all characters entered after the program name followed
			by a CR byte



	- offset 5 contains a jump address which is 2 bytes too low for
	  PSP's created by the DOS EXEC function in DOS 2.x+  Ø
	- program name and complete path can be found after the environment
	  in DOS versions after 3.0.  See offset 2Ch.

	Ø see <A HREF="bibliography.html">Bibliography</A> for reference to "Undocumented DOS"
