<B>	Offset Size	 Description</B>

	  00   dword  starting sector
	  04   word   number of sectors to write
	  06   dword  pointer to buffer


	- writes disk sectors from buffer at DS:BX or DS:[BX+6]
	- after calling this interrupt the flags register remains on the
	  stack and must be popped manually
	- sectors are logical sectors starting at the beginning of a
	  logical disk; each DOS partition on a drive unit is considered
	  one logical drive and has it's own logical sector numbers with
	  track 0 starting at the first track in the partition
	- this function uses logical drives, and is susceptible to ASSIGN
	- physical sector numbers can be converted to and from DOS sector
	  numbers with the following formulas:

	  dos_sector = (sector - 1) + (head * sectors_per_track) +
		       (track * sectors_per_track * num_heads)

	  physical_sector = 1 + (dos_sector  MOD  sectors_per_track)
	  physical_head = (dos_sector / sectors_per_track)  MOD  num_heads
	  physical_track = dos_sector / (sectors_per_track * num_heads)
