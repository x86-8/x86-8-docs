	- these structures are allocated by DOS during the scanning of the
	  CONFIG.SYS file
	- <A HREF="int_21-67.html">INT 21,67</A> can be used to allow an application to have more than
	  20 file handles;  the total number of handles is limited still to
	  the value of FILES=n in CONFIG.SYS
	- the structure of these fields is undocumented;  I do not recommend
	  relying on any of this information, instead use it as an aid in
	  debugging
	- see <A HREF="bibliography.html">Bibliography</A> references to Bernd Schemmer and "Data Structures
	  Used in IBM PC Compatibles and the PS/2".
