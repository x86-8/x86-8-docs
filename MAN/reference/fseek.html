<H2 ALIGN=Center>int fseek( FILE *fp, long offset, int mode )</H2>

<PRE>


	- prototype in stdio.h

	- sets file pointer associated with fp to position which is offset
	  bytes beyond file location given by mode

	- mode is 0 (beginning of file or SEEK_SET)
		  1 (current position or SEEK_CUR)
		  2 (end of file or SEEK_END

	- discards any character pushed back by ungetc()
	- fseek() clears eof indicator but not file error indicator
	- returns 0 if pointer moved OK, nonzero if file not opened or
	  invalid seek for device.  DOS does not report an error if an
	  attempt to seek past EOF is made
