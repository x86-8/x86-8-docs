<H2 ALIGN=Center>INT 1A,6 - Set Real Time Clock Alarm  (XT 286,AT,PS/2)</H2>

<PRE>


	AH = 06
	CH = hours in BCD
	CL = minutes in BCD
	DH = seconds in BCD


	on return:
	CF = 1 if alarm already set or clock inoperable


	- alarm setting is not relative like some sources claim, but the
	  actually clock time the interrupt should occur
	- settings values must be in BCD
	- when the alarm time is reached <A HREF="int_4a.html">INT 4A</A> is executed
	- INT 4A vector should be replaced with address of the alarm
	  handling interrupt routine before setting the alarm
	- <A HREF="int_1a-7.html">INT 1A,7</A> should be called to disable the <A HREF="cmos_ram.html">RTC</A> alarm
