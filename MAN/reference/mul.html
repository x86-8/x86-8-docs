<H2 ALIGN=Center>MUL - Unsigned Multiply</H2>

<PRE>

	Usage:	MUL	src
	Modifies flags: CF OF (AF,PF,SF,ZF undefined)

	Unsigned multiply of the accumulator by the source.  If "src" is
	a byte value, then AL is used as the other multiplicand and the
	result is placed in AX.  If "src" is a word value, then AX is
	multiplied by "src" and DX:AX receives the result.  If "src" is
	a double word value, then EAX is multiplied by "src" and EDX:EAX
	receives the result.  The 386+ uses an early out algorithm which
	makes multiplying any size value in EAX as fast as in the 8 or 16
	bit registers.
