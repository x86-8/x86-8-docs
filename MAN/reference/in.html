	A byte, word or dword is read from "port" and placed in AL, AX or
	EAX respectively.  If the port number is in the range of 0-255
	it can be specified as an immediate, otherwise the port number

	- 386+ protected mode timings depend on privilege levels.

	  first number is the timing if:    CPL ó IOPL
	  second number is the timing if:   CPL > IOPL or in VM 86 mode (386)
	  			     	    CPL ò IOPL  (486)
	  third number is the timing when:    virtual mode on 486 processor
	- 486 virtual mode always requires 27 cycles
