<B>	Programming Considerations:</B>

	Write CMOS address to read or write to port 70h
	Read/write port 71h to get/set data


	- the information here is only applicable to AT and PS/2 systems
	- INT 1A is used to read/set the Time of Day and Alarm.  To use the
	  alarm, INT 4A must be a valid interrupt service routine.
	- configuration settings are maintained using the Motorola MC146818
	  Real Time Clock.  Each of this chips 64 memory registers is used
	  for storage (0-3F).
	- Bit 5 of the diagnostic (0Eh) status byte is set during a power
	  on test.  This Bit is set if no floppy disks are found or the
	  display doesn't match the system display switch setting.
	- all addresses sent to port 70h have Bits 7&6 clear since Bit 7
	  of port 70h is used to enable/disable NMI.  Setting this Bit 7
	  enables NMI, clearing this Bit disables NMI.
	- when masking the NMI through using port 70H, port 71H should be
	  read immediately after or the RTC may be left in an unknown state.
	  This wont affect the PS/2 watchdog timer or system channel timeout.
