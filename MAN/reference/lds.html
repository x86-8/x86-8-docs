<H2 ALIGN=Center>LDS - Load Pointer Using DS</H2>

<PRE>

	Usage:	LDS	dest,src
	Modifies flags: None


	Loads 32-bit pointer from memory source to destination register
	and DS.  The offset is placed in the destination register and the
	segment is placed in DS.  To use this instruction the word at the
	lower memory address must contain the offset and the word at the
	higher address must contain the segment.  This simplifies the loading
	of far pointers from the stack and the interrupt vector table.
