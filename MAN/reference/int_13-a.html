<H2 ALIGN=Center>INT 13,A - Read Long Sector (XT & newer)</H2>

<PRE>

	AH = 0A
	AL = number of sectors	(1-121 dec.)
	CH = track number  (0-1023 dec., see below)
	CL = sector number  (1-17 dec., see below)
	DH = head number  (0-15 dec.)
	DL = fixed drive number  (80h=drive 0, 81h=drive 1)
	ES:BX = address of buffer


	on return:
	AH = status  (see <A HREF="int_13-1.html">INT 13,STATUS</A>)
	AL = number of sectors actually transferred
	CF = 0 if successful
	   = 1 if error


	- BIOS disk reads should be retried at least three times and the
	  controller should be reset upon error detection
	- many good programming references indicate this function is only
	  available on the AT, PS/2 and later systems, but all hard disk
	  systems since the XT have this function available
	- reads regular data sectors (128-1024 bytes) with an additional
	  4 byte ECC code included
	- a DMA boundary error will occur if the buffer at ES:BX crosses
	  a 64K segment boundary
	- only the disk number is checked for validity
	- the parameters in CX change depending on the number of cylinders;
	  the track/cylinder number is a 10 bit value taken from the 2 high
	  order bits of CL and the 8 bits in CH (low order 8 bits of track):

	  |F|E|D|C|B|A|9|8|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  CX
	   | | | | | | | | | | `--------------	sector number
	   | | | | | | | | `--------------  high order 2 bits of track number
	   `--------------------------	low order 8 bits of track number
