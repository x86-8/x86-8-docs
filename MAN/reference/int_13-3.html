<H2 ALIGN=Center>INT 13,3 - Write Disk Sectors</H2>

<PRE>

	AH = 03
	AL = number of sectors to write  (1-128 dec.)
	CH = track/cylinder number  (0-1023 dec.)
	CL = sector number  (1-17 dec., see below)
	DH = head number  (0-15 dec.)
	DL = drive number (0=A:, 1=2nd floppy, 80h=drive 0, 81h=drive 1)
	ES:BX = pointer to buffer


	on return:
	AH = 0 if CF=0; otherwise disk status  (see <A HREF="int_13-1.html">INT 13,STATUS</A>)
	AL = number of sectors written
	CF = 0 if successful
	   = 1 if error


	- BIOS disk write attempts should reset the controller on error
	- be sure ES:BX does not cross a 64K segment boundary or a
	  DMA boundary error will occur
	- IBM PC XT 286 does not require a value in AL, though it is
	  recommended that one be supplied for portability
	- many programming references list only floppy disk register values
	- only the disk number is checked for validity
	- the parameters in CX change depending on the number of cylinders;
	  the track/cylinder number is a 10 bit value taken from the 2 high
	  order bits of CL and the 8 bits in CH (low order 8 bits of track):

	  |F|E|D|C|B|A|9|8|7|6|5-0|  CX
	   | | | | | | | | | |	`-----	sector number
	   | | | | | | | | `---------  high order 2 bits of track/cylinder
	   `------------------------  low order 8 bits of track/cyl number
