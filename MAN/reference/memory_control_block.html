<H2 ALIGN=Center>MCB - DOS Memory Control Block Format</H2>

<PRE>

<B>     Offset Size		Description</B>

	00   byte	'M' 4Dh  member of a MCB chain, (not last)
			'Z' 5Ah  indicates last entry in MCB chain
			other values cause "Memory Allocation Failure" on exit
	01   word	<A HREF="program_segment_prefix.html">PSP</A> segment address of MCB owner (Process Id)
			possible values:
			    0 = free
			    8 = Allocated by DOS before first user pgm loaded
			    other = Process Id/PSP segment address of owner
	03   word	number of paras related to this MCB (excluding MCB)
	05 11bytes	reserved
	08  8bytes	ASCII program name, NULL terminated if less than max
			length (DOS 4.x+)
	10  nbytes	first byte of actual allocated memory block


	- to find the first MCB in the chain, use  <A HREF="int_21-52.html">INT 21,52</A>
	- DOS 3.1+ the first memory block contains the DOS data segment
	  ie., installable drivers, buffers, etc
	- DOS 4.x the first memory block is divided into subsegments,
	  with their own memory control blocks; offset 0000h is the first
	- the 'M' and 'Z' are said to represent Mark Zbikowski
	- the MCB chain is often referred to as a linked list, but
	  technically isn't
