<BODY><PRE><B>	MSC: void _splitpath( char *path, char *drive, char *dir,</B>
<B>				char *fname, char *ext )</B>

	- prototype in stdlib.h

	- dissects the path into components
	- path = fully qualified file name to dissect
	- drive = is the drive letter followed by a colon if drive was
	  specified in string
	- dir = any directories included in "path" plus '\'
	- fname = base filename w/o extension
	- ext = file extension
	- the maximum size of each component is: _MAX_DRIVE, _MAX_DIR,
	  _MAX_FNAME, _MAX_EXT (all include the NULL and are actually
	  much larger than needed, except _MAX_DRIVE is exact fit)

	- see	<A HREF="_makepath.html">_makepath</A>()
