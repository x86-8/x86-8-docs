<H2 ALIGN=Center>INT 9 - Keyboard Interrupt (Hardware Handler)</H2>

<PRE>

	no input data

<B>	related memory:</B>

	40:17 = updates keyboard flag byte 0
	40:18 = updates keyboard flag byte 1
	40:1A = queue head ptr is set to buffer start if Ctrl-Break is hit
	40:1C = updates buffer tail pointer for each keystroke; sets
		queue tail ptr is set to queue start if Ctrl-Break is hit
	40:1E = updates keyboard buffer (32 bytes)
	40:71 = updates bit 7 of the BIOS break flag if Ctrl-Break is hit
	40:72 = updates reset flag with 1234H if Ctrl-Alt-Del pressed
	40:96 = indicates keyboard type (AT,PS/2)
	40:97 = updates keyboard LED flags (AT,PS/2)
	FFFF:0 = reboot code called if Ctrl-Alt-Del pressed

<B>	related interrupts:</B>

	<A HREF="int_5.html">INT 5</A>     invoked if print screen key pressed
	<A HREF="int_1b.html">INT 1B</A>    invoked if Ctrl-Break key sequence pressed
	<A HREF="int_15-85.html">INT 15,85</A> invoked on AT if system request key is pressed
	<A HREF="int_15-4f.html">INT 15,4F</A> invoked on machines after PC/AT with AL = scan code


	- records key press and key release via IRQ1/8259 and
	  stores scan codes in the BIOS buffer located at 40:1C
	- keyboard controllers also buffer data when interrupts are
	  disabled at the <A HREF="8259.html">8259</A> interrupt controller
	- keyboard controller is capable of storing 16 keystrokes
	  even when interrupts are disabled at the 8259
	- normal INT 9 execution takes approximately 500 microseconds;
	  at least one standard XT BIOS is known to take up to 1.3
	  milliseconds to execute
