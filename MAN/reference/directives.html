<H2 ALIGN=Center>Macro Assembler Directives</H2>

<PRE>

</PRE>

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Processor Code Generation Directives</H2>

<PRE>

	.186	enables assembly of 80186 instructions
	.286	enables assembly of non privileged 80286 instructions
	.286C	same as .286
	.286P	enables assembly of all 80286 instructions
	.287	enabled assembly of 80287 instructions
	.386	enabled assembly of non privileged 80386 instructions
		If used before .MODEL segments are defined as 32bits.
		Causes all segments to default to DWORD alignment.
	.386P	enabled assembly of all 80386 instructions (see .386)
	.387	enabled assembly of 80387 instructions
	.8086	default, enables assembly of 8088/8086 instruction
	.8087	default, enables assembly of 8087 instructions


	These directives must precede the segment they are to effect.
	they cannot occur within a segment.


</PRE>

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Memory Model Directives</H2>

<PRE>

	.CODE  [name]	starts code segment; must follow .MODEL directive
	.CONST		starts a constant data segment with name CONST;
			must follow .MODEL directive; placed in DGROUP
	.DATA		starts a near data segment for initialized data
			with name _DATA; must follow .MODEL directive;
			placed in DGROUP
	.DATA?		starts a near data segment for uninitialized
			data with name _BSS; must follow .MODEL
			directive; placed in DGROUP
	.FARDATA [name]	not placed in any group
	.FARDATA? [name] not placed in any group
	.MODEL model	defines memory model to be one of the following:
			SMALL, COMPACT, MEDIUM, LARGE or HUGE;	must be
			used prior to any other segment directive
	.STACK [size]	indicates start of stack segment named 'STACK'
			with size indicating number of bytes to reserve,
			default is 1k; placed in DGROUP


</PRE>

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Segment Definition, Segment Ordering and Linkage Directives</H2>

<PRE>

	.ALPHA		orders segments alphabetically
	.SEQ		orders segments sequentially (default)
	ASSUME sreg:name [,sreg:name...]   selects default segment
			register to be used by the assembler, not the CPU,
			for addressing all symbols in the segment or group.
			Name must be associated with a SEGMENT or GROUP
			or set to "NOTHING" to indicate no segment register
			is to be associated.
	COMM def [,def...]  defines variables that are both public and
			external (communal).  Can be used in and include
			file to identify it to each source file without
			declaring it in each model as extern.  Actually
			defines data once.  Communal variables cannot be
			initialized, and are not guaranteed to be allocated
			contiguously since these are allocated by the linker.
	DOSSEG		orders segments the same as DOS.  This is Microsoft
			languages default order; causes paragph alignment
	END [name]	marks end of source module and sets program
			start address (CS:IP) if 'name' is present
   name ENDP		ends procedure 'name'
   name ENDS		ends a segment or structure
	EXTRN name:type [,name:type...]  defines one or more external symbols
   name GROUP seg[,seg]
   name LABEL [NEAR|FAR|PROC]  defines an entry point;	If PROC is specified,
			it's value depends on the current MODEL
	NAME pgmName	ignored since MASM 5.0; used to set module name
   name PROC [NEAR|FAR]	defines procedure; NEAR/FAR has .MODEL default
	PUBLIC name[,name...]  makes symbol 'name' available to other modules
   name SEGMENT [align][combine][use]['class']
		align	= BYTE	align on byte address (no alignment)
			= WORD	align on even address
			= DWORD	align on DWORD address
			= PARA	align on next 16 byte paragraph
			= PAGE	align on next 256 byte boundary
		combine = PUBLIC  similar named segments are concatenated (CS)
			= STACK   similar named segments are concatenated (SS)
			= COMMON  similar named segment are overlapped
			= MEMORY  similar names segments are concatenated
			= AT addr segment relative to absolute address
			= nothing segment is private and loaded independent
		use	= USE16   segments will be 16 bits (if .386)
			= USE32   segments will be 32 bits (if .386)


</PRE>

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Data Allocation Directives</H2>

<PRE>

	ALIGN n		aligns next variable or instruction on a boundary
			that is a multiple of "n".  This can speed memory
			fetches on 16 and 32 bit CPU'S if aligned.  New to
			<A HREF="masm_options.html">MASM</A> 5.0, previous versions used EVEN.  Can result
			in NOP's added to code.
 [name]	DB init[,init...]  define byte
 [name]	DD init[,init...]  define double word (DWORD, 4 bytes)
 [name]	DF init[,init...]  define far word (FWORD, 386, 6 bytes)
 [name]	DQ init[,init...]  define quad word (QWORD, 8 bytes)
 [name]	DT init[,init...]  define temp word (TBYTE, 10 bytes)
 [name]	DW init[,init...]  define word (WORD, 2 bytes)
  count	DUP (init[,init...]) duplicate 'init' 'count' times; DUP can be
			nested to 17 levels; DUP'ed initial values
			of (?) don't result in data in the object file
			but instead increment the next data addr
   name	ENDS		end of structure or segment
	EVEN		same as align 2;  Aligns data on even boundary
	ORG expr	sets location counter to 'expr';  If 'expr'
			is '$' the code is ORG'ed at the current loc.
   name	RECORD fld[,fld...]  defines a byte or word variable
			consisting of bit fields;  fields have the format:
			fieldname:width[=expr];  the sum of all widths
			must be <= 0
 [name]	STRUC <[init[,init]]>  defines beginning of a structure; Values
 			between <> are initializers;  The '<>' symbols
			are required.
