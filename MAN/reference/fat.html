<H2 ALIGN=Center>FAT - File Allocation Table</H2>

<PRE>

<B>	12 Bit			  Meaning		    16 Bit</B>

	 000			 free space		     0000
	 FF1-FF7	      bad track marking		     FFF1-FFF7
	 FF8-FFE   may be used to mark end of a file chain   FFF8-FFFE
	 FFF	   standard marker for end of a file chain   FFFF


	- the FAT is implemented as an array containing a linked list
	  for each file;  the files directory entry has a pointer to the
	  first cluster which contains the cluster number of the next
	  cluster in the chain until the pointer contained is FFFh
	  (12 bit FAT) and FFFFh (16 bit FAT) marking end of file
	- DOS maintains two copies of the FAT, but does not use the
	  second copy for anything other than a mirror image of the
	  first;  CHKDSK doesn't even read the second FAT
	- disks with FF1h clusters and above use 16 bit FAT tables, disk
	  with less use 12 bit FAT tables
	- DOS 4.x did not change the size of the cluster number as some
	  suggest, but instead increased the size of the sector number
	- bytes 0 of the FAT contains the Media Descriptor Byte

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Calculating 12 bit FAT Entries</H2>

<PRE>

	1. Get starting cluster from directory entry.

	2. Multiply the cluster number just used by 1.5

	3. The whole part of the product is the offset into the FAT,
	   of the entry that maps to the cluster in the directory.
	   This entry contains the number of the next cluster.

	4. Move the word at the calculated FAT into a register.

	5. If the last cluster used was an even number, keep the low order
	   12 bits of the register, otherwise, keep the high order 12 bits.

	6. If the resultant 12 bits are (0FF8h-0FFFh) no more clusters
	   are in the file.  Otherwise, the next 12 bits contain the
	   cluster number of the next cluster in the file.


</PRE>

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Calculating 16 Bit FAT Entries</H2>

<PRE>

	1. Get the starting cluster of the file from the directory.

	2. Multiply the cluster number found by 2.

	3. Load the word at the calculated FAT offset into a register.

	4. If the 16 bits are (0FFF8h-0FFFFh) no more clusters are in
	   the file. Otherwise, the 16 bits contain the cluster number
	   of the next cluster in the file.


	To convert the cluster to a logical sector number (relative
	sector, similar to that used by DEBUG, int 25h and 26h):

	1. Subtract 2 from the cluster number
	2. Multiply the result by the number of sectors per cluster.
	3. Add the logical sector number of the beginning of the data area.
