<H2 ALIGN=Center>INT 21,4F - Find Next Matching File</H2>

<PRE>


	AH = 4F
	DS:DX = unchanged from previous function 4E


	on return:
	AX = error code if CF set  (see <A HREF="dos_error_codes.html">DOS ERROR CODES</A>)


	- <A HREF="int_21-4e.html">INT 21,4E</A> should be called to find the first file and this
	  function should be called to find all other matching files
	- normal files are always included along with files that match
	  the requested attributes except when the LABEL attribute is
	  requested.  It's up to the programmer to determine which
	  actually match the requested attributes.
