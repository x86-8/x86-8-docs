Everything preceding a line beginning with the six characters "!begin" is
a comment and will be ignored (with the proviso that the total file size
not exceed 64K).  Everything from the !begin line to a line starting with
the four characters "!end" forms part of the device description, in a
format similar to that used for printf().

[See file BLANK.PCI for description of formatting specification and how
to create your own device descriptions.]
