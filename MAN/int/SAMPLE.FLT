# Sample filtering file.  Lines starting with a hash mark in the first
# column are comments.	Actual filtering lines start with either a dash
# or a plus sign in the first column (additional modes may be added in
# the future).	Lines starting with a dash specify that interrupt list
# entries containing that string in the first line will be omitted from
# the formatted output; lines starting with a plus sign specify that
# interrupt list entries containing that string are to be included in
# the formatted output unless one of the minus lines matches.

# Extract MS-DOS calls, but exclude DR-DOS-specific, DOS-extender, and
# non-DOS networking calls.  Note: a few extraneous calls are still included.
