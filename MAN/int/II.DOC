 This program is not finished nor bug-free.




 System-requirements:

 MS-DOS 5.0
 150kb conventional (low) memory
 101/102-keys keyboard (other might work)
 80486 recommended
 VGA-card recommended




 Features:

 * Simple file-requester for simple changing of .LST-file to view.
 * Hex-viewer
 * .LST-file-viewer with support for searching and saving topics.




 Usage:

 Running II.EXE without params brings up a simple file-requester, showing
 current directory. If a file is specified at command-line, that file is
 opened for viewing.




 File-requester:

 The file-requester is very simple. All files appears in a list. Choose file
 to view - either in hex-format or as text. Text-viewer only supports .LST-
 files due to some special features (see below).

 Keys:
 Cursor up/down - Change current file
 H              - Hex-view current file
 Return         - Open topiclist for current file




 Topic-list:

 If a file is choosen from file-requester or specified at command-line, a
 indexfile is created (named FILENAME.II). The indexfile is used to improve
 speed for both topiclist and searching. When index is created (which might
 take a few minutes on slow computers) a list of all topics in the .LST-file
 is shown on screen.

 Keys:
 Cursor up/down - Change topic
 Home/end       - Beginning/end of list
 Page up/down   - Scroll list one page up/down
 Return         - View topic
 F2             - Search for text-string
 F3             - Repeat search (use same text-string)
 S              - Save topic to disk




 Topic-viewer:

 This viewer has some features that I haven't seen in any other interrupt-
 list-viewer. Searching has already been mentioned. Being able to view all
 "see-also"-references is real handy.

 Keys:
 Cursor up/down - Scroll through topic
 Page up/down   -        - || -
 Cursor left/right - View previous/next topic
 F2             - Search for text-string
 F3             - Repeat search (use same text-string)
 S              - Save topic to disk
 Tab            - Change "see-alse"-reference
 Return         - Goto current "see-also"-reference
 Backspace      - Goto previously viewed topic




 Known bugs:

 * Program sometimes messes up search-string
 * After viewing a topic, program sometimes returns to wrong part of topiclist.
 * Doesn't find all "see-also:"-references.
 * .II-files shouldn't appear in file-requester.
 * Topic-viewer can only show topics smaller than 65520 bytes.
