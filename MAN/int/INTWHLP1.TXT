  The source and the compiled EXE-file can be freely distributed as long as
  no changes are made without my knowledge.

  --------------------------------
  Notes:
   The program was tested with INTLIST38 and INTLIST39 and its output
     was successfully compiled with the MS-Help-compiler "HC31.EXE" V3.10.445.

   The program needs the file "INTWHLP.DAT" in the 'source' directory.

   The program converted all sourcefiles (INTERRUP.* and *.LST) to
     13 RTF files which needed 11MB on my harddrive.

   Compiling the RTF-files without compression took 13 minutes in
     a DOS-Window under Win/NT on a 486-50 (if you run it under DOS
     and if you have a fast hardrive cache, it might be faster).

   The (uncompressed) compiled HLP-File was approximately 7MB large.
   If you want to create a compressed HLP-file, you have to exchange the
     comments in the generated help-project file ("RB.HPJ"). Compressing
     reduces the size of the HLP-file to 3MB but it takes
     *more* (?? 28MB ??)  space on your harddrive while compiling.
     In order to speed up compiling the compressed file, I've included a
     temporary file ("RB.PH") of the helpcompiler in this archive.
     Copy this file into the directory containing all the RTF files
     before starting the compiler. This file is specific for INTERLIST39, so
     if you want to get maximal compression in future versions, remove it.

   After the compilation finishes, you will find the file "RB.HLP".
     Start Windows, create an icon in the program manager and double-click on it.


  --------------------------------

   If you find this program usefull, if it does not work or if you have ideas
   how to expand its functionality, feel fee to write an e-mail to me.

   As usual, I do not take any responsibility for possible damages done by
   this program.


  Two questions and their answers :
  ---------------------------------
   WHY is the HLP-file so large ?
     In contrast to other programs that convert the interrupt list to
     DOS-based hypertext systems, this program generates a large
     index file that allows you to search for keywords.

   WHY did I wrote this program in Pascal and not in C ?
     I think Pascal is a pretty nice language for small projects.
     Another reason is the availability of efficient string handling under Pascal.
