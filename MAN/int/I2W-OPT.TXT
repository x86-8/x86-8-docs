INT2WHLP Interrupt List  -> WinHelp converter. 

Syntax is:
	INT2WHLP [options] [InPath [options] [OutPath [options]]]

InPpath is the source file directory. The program will use INTERRUP.LST
as the input file if it exists, or else it will use INTERRUP.A and consecutive
INTERRUP.B, ..., . The files CATEGORY.KEY and OVERVIEW.LST should also be in
the InPath directory. See also I2W-CFG.TXT's [WINDOWS] section.

OutPath is the output directory where the INTWIN.HPJ and *.RTF files will go.
The program will request InPath and OutPath if they are not specified as
parameters or in a configuration file.

Options are introduced by "-" or "/", and they are not case sensitive.
On switch options of the form "-E+" or "-E-", actually only the "-" in
position 3 is significant to turn the option off, "-E" alone or any other
string after "E" turns the option on.
Options taking an argument can optionally have a ":" after the option
character, e.g. "-C:medium" or "-Cmedium".

All the options can also be controlled by entries in the configuration file's
[OPTION] section (see I2W-OPT.TXT). Options specified as program parameters
take precedence over options specified in the configuration file.

Implemented options are:
	-1[+|-]		Single-entry interrupt numbers are listed directly
			in the Interrupts index if this option is enabled,
			instead of a reference "INT nn ..." to a one-entry
			index.
			Default is disabled, for a filtered list with many
			single-entry interrupts enabling is preferable.
			Configuration file key "singlesInMain".
	-2[+|-]		The program can maintain two indexes, "Interrupt
			Index" (all entries) and "Interrupts" (index with
			subindexes). -2- disables Interrupt Index.
			Default is enabled.
			Configuration file key "twoIndexes".
	-B[:]<build>	Inserts 'BUILD=<build>' in the HPJ file's [OPTIONS]
			section if <build> is not the empty string. Don't
			use any spaces in the <build> expression. Note
                        that the OR operator "|" cannot be passed in an
                        option because DOS interprets it as a pipe redirection.
                        Use the configuration file if the OR operator is
                        needed.
                        Configuration file key "build".
	-C[:][arg]	Controls HCxx's Compression ratio. If no -C option
			is used, compression is set to NO. If -C or -C: is
			used alone, compression is set to YES. Any argument
			is passed to HCxx, legal arguments are: 0, NO, OFF
			for no compression, MEDIUM for medium compression,
			or 1, YES, HIGH for high compression.
			Configuration file key "compression".
	-E[+|-]		Controls opening of a HCxx error log file INTWIN.ERR.
			Default is no error log.
	-F[:]<filter>	Specifies the name of the Filter file for a partial
			compilation of the Interrupt List. The filter file
			must be in the current directory, or the path must
			be given.
			NOTE! It is recommended not to perform a partial
			compilation because references to tables may then be
			missing.
			Configuration file key "filterFile".
	-H[+|-]		Controls Headers in the Interrupt Index. If disabled,
			only the entries are listed in the index. If enabled,
			each new interrupt number gets a heading "INT nn ...".
			Default is enabled. -H is ignored if -2- is
			specified.
			Configuration file key "headers".
	-I[:]<columns>	Specifies the number of columns in the compressed
			Index. Legal values are 1, 4, 8, or 16. Default is
			1.
			Configuration file key "indexColumns".
	-K[:]c[+|-]...	Crontrols transfer of keywords to secondary keyword
			tables in intwin.hlp. c is a letter. So far only T is
			supported. -KT causes all #nnnn table keywords to be
			moved to a TWBTREE table in intwin.hlp, and -KT-
			overrides a possible setting in the configuration
			file, thus storing the #nnnn keywords in the primary
			table in intwin.hlp.
			Configuration file key "keywordTable".
	-L[+|-]		Controls whether both long and sort versions of
			interrupt search keys are used, or short versions
			only. A long search key is e.g. "INT 10 AH = 0", and
			the correspoding short key is "10 00". Disabling long
			search keys reduces the total number of keywords by
			appr. 20% and can prolong the period that WinHelp 4.0
			can support keyword search on intwin.hlp. WinHelp 4.0
			has a limited keyword capacity.
			Default is long search keys enabled.
			Configuration file key "longKeys".
	-M[+|-]		Controls whether or not keywords (like "See also:",
			"Notes:") are marked (bolded). The program compiles
			the List 20% faster, and HC31 yields a 1% shorter
			.HLP file when disabled, but the readability of the
			result is lower.
			Default is marking enabled.
			Configuration file key "markKeys".
	-Q[+|-]		Controls blanks around the eQual sign in search
			strings "INT nn AH = ff" or "INT nn AH=ff". Default
			is blanks enabled.
			Configuration file key "equalBlanks".
	-R[:]<release>  The release specification controls Interrupt List
			release number dependent behavior of INT2WHLP.
			Implemented influence:
			  releaseNo<41:	Tables are not treated as separate
			  		topics, no table cross references.
			Configuration file key "releaseNo".
	-S[+|-]		Controls the Scrolling of index headers. Indexes
			have a main header describing the Interrupt List,
			and an individual title. If scrolling is enabled,
			the title will scroll with the rest of the index,
			if disabled, the title will be part of the non-
			scrolling header. Scrolling is enabled by default.
			Configuration file key "scrollIndexTitle".
	-T[+|-]		Controls whether tables appear in a secodary
			window or in the main window. The -T option is
			ignored if the -R option disables separate table
			topics.
			Table windows are enabled by default.
			Configuration file key "tableWindow".
	-X[+|-]		Controls whether the Interrupt List Index initially
			pops up in eXpanded (all entries in one window) or
			in compressed (index with subindexes) format.
			Expanded index is enabled by default.
			Configuration file key "expandedIndex".
