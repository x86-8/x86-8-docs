Information on the INT 10h functions supported by the EGA BIOS was derived
from the article "Graphic Enhancement" found in the April 1985 _PC Tech
Journal_, pages 58ff., and is marked with the string (EGA). jrh.

derived from a similar list compiled by David E. Powell, and added by
Ralf Brown 11/14/87.

the specification by Dick Flanagan.  Added by Ralf Brown, 11/20/87.

Some of the information on MCGA/VGA BIOS calls was derived from _Byte_,
Volume 12 Number 12.

Various and sundry info on which machines support which calls was derived from
the BIOS comparison in _Byte_, Volume 12 Number 12 and added by Ralf Brown,

considering that most of his interrupt listing is derived from this one (a
