The program INT2GUID converts the Interrupt list files into an input file
for the TurboPower Software MAKEHELP program to create a GUIDE or POPHELP
Popup Reference Machine database. The program is a transcription of INT2QH
written by Kai Uwe Rommel.

GUIDE is included in some versions of the Turbo Professional package, and
POPHELP is included in the Object Professional package from TurboPower
Software. MAKEHELP is included in both packages and compiles help files
for its accompanying popup program.
 
INT2GUID reads either the interrup.lst file or the partial interrup.a ...
files, and other files defined in the INT2GUID and in the configuration file
INT2GUID.CFG. The files must be located in the current directory. The
created MakeHelp source file is written to standard output and can be
redirected. Two temporary files topic.tmp and subtopic.tmp are created in
the current directory during the process.

The configuration file allows conditional compilation, and it is configured
for a compilation that is acceptable by both versions of MAKEHELP. It can
be edited for compilations optimized for GUIDE or POPHELP, see comments in
INT2GUID.CFG.

From the 2/91 list, INT2GUID creates a 1.6M source file for MAKEHELP which
then creates a help database of about 1.3M (poor compression ratio!).
INT2GUID executes i 1'15" on a 20 MHz 386 based machine, and MAKEHELP
executes in 2'40".

The 2/91 Interrupt list, and other files used for this help system,
includes about 2500 topics. The topics are in general listed in 18 lines
sub and sub-sub indices, and the sub indices are again listed in the main
index. GUIDE and POPHELP can also pop up on a topic indicated by an
interrupt number at the cursor's position on the screen.

GUIDE is capable of handling about 4300 topics, and POPHELP can handle
about 5000.

1992-04-16. INT2GUID generates a 2.3 MB file with 3505 topics from the
INTER29x files (February 1992), and the database file is 1.8 MB long.


1992-12-19. The configuration file that is included with INT2GUID v. 1.07
is optimized for POPHELP. The main reason is that the Interrrupt List has
grown to exceed the capacity of the GUIDE program. INT2GUID can create one
or two help files for the GUIDE program from selected parts of the Interrupt
List. The configuration file should be edited for GUIDE optimization, see
comments in the file. If two help files are created, the initial part of
INTERRUP.A should be the initial part of both source files. GUIDE should
be initialized with the file requesting more resources, so sufficient memory
will be allocated to serve any of them, thus the proper file can be activated
by F3 when GUIDE is active.

The average topic length has been reduced since the first versions of
INT2GUID to appr. 7.6 characters, allowing about 8600 topics in the POPHELP
system. Facilities are included in INT2GUID v. 1.07 to include Function
Classification characters as parts of the topic names. Function Classification
will be introduced in the Interrupt List after release 33. This will increase
the average length by two characters, thus reducing the maximum number of
topics to about 6800. The facility can be enabled and disabled in the
configuration file INT2GUID.CFG.

INT2GUID generates a 3.1 MB file with 4842 topics from the Interrupt List
files release 32 (September 1992), and the database file is 2.6 MB long.

1993-04-12: Minor editings in INT2GUID.C, POPHINTS.TXT, and INT2GUID.HLP.
Classification enabled in INT2GUID.CFG. INT2GUID.TBL updated to Interrupt
List release 34.

INT2GUID generates a 3.4 MB file with 5193 topics from the Interrupt List
files release 34 (April 1993), it uses 350 kB disk space for temporary files
in the current directory, and the database file created by MAKEHELP is 2.8 MB
long.

1993-07-03: Fixed a bug in INT2GUID. The bug was introduced i version 1.07
and caused an infinite loop if the input source was a single INTERRUP.LST
file.

Ralf Brown's INTPRINT program provides an exelent filter that can reduce
the size of the database file for POPHELP/GUIDE. New options in INTPRINT
will keep the original divider lines (-k) and avoid paging (-l0), so the
result can be used as input for INT2GUID. Use
    INTPRINT -k -l0 -L1 -FINT2GUID.FLT [-sSUMMARY] -m INTERRUP.A INTERRUP.LST
where INT2GUID.FLT is a file with filter information. The optional SUMMARY
file eases the adjustment of the filter. An INT2GUID.FLT file is included
in this package which filters out about 3/4 of the Interrupt List. See also
INTPRINT.DOC for filter file formats. Notice that a filtered version of the
Interrupt List cannot legally be publicly distributed due to copyright
restrictions.

1994-03-19: INT2GUID version 1.10 must have a parameter "-nofilter" or
"-f<file name>" to specify in the copyright notice if the transcription is
based on a filtered version of the Interrupt list. <file name> is the name
of an INTPRINT filter file used to create a partial Interrupt List. If
-f<file name> is specified, INT2GUID will include topic "Filter File" with
the contents of file INT2GUID.RE2 followed by the contents of the specified
file. INT2GUID will toggle MAKEHELP text attribute 1 before and after the
included filter file. The default MAKEHELP attribute 1 (and the alternative
attribute suggested in file POPHINTS.TXT section 4) uses an alternate
background color, so trailing blanks appear in the output.

It is legal to redistrubute also partial transcriptions of Ralf Brown's
Interrupt List provided that it is stated in the copyright notice. INT2GUID
does its best to include the proper information, notice however that the
user of INT2GUID is responsible for correct copyright notices in
redistributed transcriptions.

1994-11-02: The Interrupt List has grown so big that POPHELP can no longer
handle the whole list. Thus it is necessary to pass the list through a filter
before compiling it. Remember to specify the filter file name to INT2GUID
also with the -f<file name> option.

1995-10-07: The filter file INT2GUID.FLT in this package filters the
Interrupt List slightly more aggressively than the previous filter file.
Included is also a filter file INT2G-NW.FLT which creates a network help
file. If POPHELP is started with the larger help file (created with
INT2GUID.FLT) you can change between the two help files using the F3
keystroke in POPHELP.
