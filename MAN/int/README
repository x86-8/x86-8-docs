Run MAKEHELP.BAT to convert the list into a QUICKHELP database
    INT2HM.COM   to convert the list into an HELPMAKE input file
    HM2HLP.BAT   to convert INT2HM output file into QUICKHELP database


HM2HLP.BAT and MAKEHELP.BAT take as command argument the compression
factor to use for HELPMAKE. Compression goes from 0 (NO COMPR.) to
15 (MAX COMPR.), if no argument is inserted, NORMAL COMPRESSION will
be used (3).

                        REQUIREMENTS
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Be sure that you have more than 4 times 'INTERRUPT.LST' size, 
free hard disk space before running MAKEHELP, after MAKEHELP finished 
without errors you can delete all files but INTERRUP.HLP (the
QUICKHELP database). If you haven't enough free space, run first
INT2HM.COM, delete all files but *.HM, then run HM2HLP.BAT .

INT2HM requires these files in the current work directory for the 
conversion:
 þGLOSSARY.LST
 þFARCALL.LST
 þPORTS.LST
 þMEMORY.LST
 þCMOS.LST
 þCATEGORY.KEY
 þINTERRUP.LST (run COMBINE.BAT to build it, then delete
                the INTERRUP.? files if you need free space)

to run MAKEHELP include also:
 þINT2HM.COM (the HELPMAKE conversion program)
 þHELPMAKE.EXE (the .HLP builder)

Hard disk cachers strongly recommended!

                            INFO
                            ^^^^
INTERRUP.HLP includes a file selection menu (for CMOS, PORTS, MEMORY,
INTERRUPTS and FAR CALLS) and full topic indexing on PORTS.LST and
INTERRUP.LST with a one level index for PORTS and a two level index
for INTERRUPTS (one for INT numbers and one for all entries for a
specified INT number). 
INTERRUPT entries are all classified with the searching category flag
reported in CATEGORY.KEY and the type description included directly in 
the list (undocumented, internal, ....) so that class searching is
also possible with QUICKHELP searching functions.
