The resident help system is controlled by the program GUIDE or its successor
POPHELP.

The GUIDE resident help program (a Popup Reference Engine) is copyright
TurboPower Software. It is part of the program package Turbo Professional.
The copyright notice states:
   GUIDE.EXE, MAKEHELP.EXE, and the Turbo Professional help files are
   copyrighted property of TurboPower Software. The Turbo Professional help
   files and MAKEHELP.EXE are intended for the sole use of the licensed
   owner of a copy of Turbo Professional. However, TurboPower Software
   grants you the right to distribute GUIDE.EXE along with help files
   of your own design.

GUIDE displays information about default settings and instructs how to
customize the settings if you enter "GUIDE /?" from the DOS prompt.

The second and third level of index screens in this file are essentially
help screens, and GUIDE's cross reference facility is used to select the
topic. Most of the screens will display on one page if the height is set
to 20 lines.

GUIDE has three hot keys for: Look up help topic, Redisplay previous
help topic, and Display help index. The "Look up help topic" facility
searches for a topics retrieved from the screen at the cursor position
and pops up, if possible, on the right one.

The amount of text that can be displayed is limited by the number of pages
per topic defined in GUIDE (default = 20, defined when GUIDE was compiled),
and the screen height that can be defined when GUIDE is initialized. The
biggest topic in the INTERRUPT release 2/91 has about 850 lines of text,
thus requiring many long pages to show them all. GUIDE supports 43/50 lines
on EGA/VGA screens; the height shrinks to 25 lines if GUIDE pops up when
the display mode is set to a standard 25 lines screen.

Within GUIDE, use
   F1      for GUIDE index.
   <Alt>F1 for former help screen.
   F3      for new help file (error 203: unload GUIDE, load with new file). 
   F5      to move the window.

Most of what is stated above about GUIDE holds true also for POPHELP, part
of the package Object Professional from TurboPower Software. However, POPHELP
has a scrolling system capable of showing all the text independent of the
screen height, and it has several facilities not included in GUIDE.

POPHELP defines the height as active lines, whereas GUIDE includes two lines
for the frame, therefore height 18 is a good choice when using POPHELP.
POPHELP can readjust the height when active.
