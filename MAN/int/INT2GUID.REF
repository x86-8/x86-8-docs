The programs GUIDE and POPHELP are copyright TurboPower Software and can
be distributed only with a proper version of the file INTERRUP.HLP, see
5GUIDE.

The program that compiled the information in Ralf Brown's files into a
file that could be used to generate this Help System is based on a program
written by Kai Uwe Rommel.

Because the line length in the GUIDE Help System is limited to 76 characters,
some lines will be truncated 1 - 2 characters early.
