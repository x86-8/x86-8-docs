RBIL Viewer v2.1
================

Quick start:
------------

Run RBILVIEW.EXE, if no lists show up under the 'Open List' menu, then
go to 'Options' -> 'Configuration...' and change 'Location of list files'
by clicking on the map icon. Select the folder that contains the files
of The Interrupt List. 

If 'INTERRUP.LST' doesn't show up under the 'Open List' menu (but other
files of The Interrupt List do), then make sure that you have combined
all parts of 'INTERRUP.LST' into one file. You can use 'COMBINE.COM' for 
this (this program is distributed along with The Interrupt List).


Quick notes for v1.xx users:
----------------------------

The List menu has been moved to 'File' -> 'Open List', to quickly open
a list, select the downwards facing arrow beside the Open button on 
the toolbar.

The standard Copy option will NOT copy the entire topic when no text has
been selected (as was the case in prior versions). Instead you can use
Select All and then Copy or use the key combination Shift+Ctrl+C to copy
the entire topic quickly.

The 'Create new indexfile' option is now called 'Update topic titles'.
