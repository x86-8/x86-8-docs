 === Int2TPH Interrupt List Compiler v1.2 (C) 1996 Slava Gostrenko ===


     Introduction.

     This program converts Ralf Brown's Interrupt List into Borland Turbo Help
File  (.TPH  file  format)  to  use  it  with Turbo Help TSR or within Borland
(Turbo) Pascal IDE.
     Int2TPH  uses  hypertext  features of the Interrupt List. It is the first
(and  the  only)  Interrupt  List  compiler that makes a real hypertext of the
Interrupt  List.  It  is  made  possible due to an advanced pattern processing
technique used in the compiler.
     Not  only it creates comprehensive indexes for all the topics in the list
but it also allows users to add their own indexes to the help file.


     Usage.

     Unpack  all the Interrupt List and Int2TPH files into one directory. Make
sure  that  there  is  at  least 13Mb of free space left on the drive. You may
need up to 17Mb of free space if you computer has less than 5Mb of RAM. Try to
free  up  to 4Mb of XMS memory (BIOS provided XMS suites as well as the memory
provided  by  himem  or any other XMS driver). The rest of the RAM may be used
for  disk  caching  provided  by any disk cache driver or operating system you
have.
     Int2TPH  is  a  protected  mode (DPMI) program. So it is assumed that you
have  alredy  configured  RTM  (DPMI  Runtime  manager that comes with Borland
Pascal).  In fact the actual configuration (with the help of DPMIInst program)
is  required  if  you have a 286 class computer. Otherwise it is only required
that RTM.EXE and DPMI16BI.OVL can be found using PATH environment variable.
     Run Int2TPH. After a while it will create Inter.TPH file that is the help
file you've been waiting for.

     To use the help file within Borland Pascal IDE click Help->Files...->New
and enter the help file name.
     To use the help file with Turbo Help TSR run THelp.Com with the help file
name passed as a parameter using /f option of THelp. The command line may look
like this:
     THelp /fInter.TPH


     Note.

     The  main  index of the Interrupt List (that is generated on Shift-F1) is
too  large  for  THelp. To solve this problem run Int2TPH with the /ShortIndex
option.  Borland  Pascal  IDE  works fine with the default extended main index
version.


     User defined idexes.

     To  define  your  own  index edit Int_Keys.Txt file. It is a list of user
defined  key  words  that  are  used  for  indexing.  Each word in the list is
searched  in  the  Interrupt  List topics. All the topics containing given key
word  will  be  listed  in  the  separate  index  topic. The key word used for
indexing will be the name of the topic.


     Technical notes.

     While  running Int2TPH creates 2 temporary files. Int2TPH.Swp is the main
swap  file  for  virtual memory. Topics.Swp is the swap file for the Interrupt
List  topics.  Temporary  files  are  deleted on the normal termination of the
program.
     The   Incomplt.Log  file  is  a  log  of  the  ambiguous  search  pattern
applications. Normaly you don't need this file.
     While  running Int2TPH displays it's current status and may display error
messages.  I've  debugged Int2TPH to run well on the Interrupt List Release 50
and  added  lots  of error checks to the program to make it easier to find the
incompatabilities  of  the  compiler's  algorithms  and  new  releases  of the
Interrupt  List.  So  let me know if you have a newer version of the Interrupt
List that is compiled with errors.
