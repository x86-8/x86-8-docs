Notes:	the variant of the call requesting five bytes is an UNDOCUMENTED
	  extension supported by Adaptec's ASPI2DOS.SYS, ASPI4DOS.SYS, and
	  ASPI7DOS.SYS; if made of a host manager which does not support the
	  variant, only four bytes will be returned.  If the variant is
	  supported, Adaptec's WINASPI.DLL assumes that the host manager is
	  an "advanced" one which operates in either real or protected mode
	  (and thus does not require a DPMI INT 31/AX=0301h call to be invoked
	  from protected mode).	 Support of the five-byte variant also appears
	  to imply that an advanced ASPI host manager uses no temporary
	  storage space except the SRB (see #01454) and the stack, and that it
	  is fully reentrant.
	if called with a standard request for four bytes, even Adaptec's
	  advanced drivers return only the requested four bytes containing the
	  ASPI entry point address
	the function address is called with the address of a SCSI Request
	  Block (see #01454) on the stack and the caller must clean up the
	  stack

	  hence the AH and AL must be checked seperately.
	In DR DOS 3.31-6.0, and DR PalmDOS, DX=AX on return.
	For Novell DOS 7 - DR DOS 7.03 the DX value returned by this function
	  is the same as the DX value returned by INT 21/AX=3306h, and
	  represents the DOS revision (bits 7-0, currently always DL=00h) and
	  the version flags (bits 15-8, with bit 12 = DOS in HMA, bit 11 = DOS
	  in ROM) of the "patch_version" field in the PCM_HEADER structure in
	  the IBMDOS.COM file. The version flags, however, are updated at
	  runtime to reflect the actual system status, resulting, for example,
	  in DH=10h for DOS in HMA, and DH=0 when booting Novell DOS 7 from
	  installation disks.
	The operating system version ID represents the BDOS (Basic Disk
	  Operating System) kernel version (of the DRBDOS.SYS aka IBMDOS.COM
	  file), and the two nibbles can actually be read as CP/M version
	  and sub-version, that is DR-DOS 7.03 (version code 1073h) is
	  actually CP/M-86 version 7.3.
	Due to lost original patch sources from the backups, Caldera OpenDOS
	  7.01 merely represented Novell DOS 7 Update 10 with minor changes.
	For Caldera DR-OpenDOS 7.02, all the Novell DOS 7 patches up to
	  including Update 15.2 have been re-incorporated into the system
	  from other sources, while the missing patches for IBMBIO.COM were
	  independently re-implemented by Matthias Paul in 07/1997-10/1997.
	Novell DOS 7 (since 1993-11-08), OpenDOS 7.01 and OpenDOS 7.02 BETA
	  IBMDOS.COM return error code 0001h if SETVER x.255 is in effect
	  for the calling program, or SETVER /G x.255 is in effect.
	Since Caldera DR-OpenDOS 7.02 the SHARE 2.05+ (1998-01-05) driver
	  uses INT 21/AX=65A2h as an *additional* BDOS version check: If the
	  "FUCASE char" function is functional on a DR-DOS BDOS kernel 72h+,
	  SHARE assumes it is running on an OpenDOS 7.02 BETA 1 (73h) kernel
	  (or later) even if the BDOS version returned by INT 21/AX=4452h would
	  indicate an earlier issue of the kernel. Some 3rd party drivers
	  (like HPFS_DOS.EXE) were hardwired to detect Novell DOS 7 only,
	  and so the kernel version had to be patched back on such systems
	  to allow such drivers to work properly. The BDOS version and DOS
	  revision are stored in PCM_HEADER of the IBMDOS.COM file, see
	  table XXXX below.
	However, this is no longer necessary with the introduction of the
	  DR-DOS 7.02+ IBMDOS.COM (since 1998-01-10) and SETVER 1.01+
	  (since 1998-01-12) because they allow to fake BDOS versions as well
	  as faking DOS versions. In /X mode, a set sub-version of y = 100..127
	  will be used as BDOS version instead (64h..7Fh), while the DOS
	  revision will be used to report the DOS sub-version instead. For
	  example, given a DOS revision of 0, SETVER 6.114 would be the proper
	  value to fake Novell DOS 7 (114=72h) on a DR-DOS 7.02+ system,
	  reporting a DOS version of "IBM" 6.00. Sub-versions 128..255 will
	  completely disable this BDOS version check, and report a DOS sub-
	  version of 0..127. This is to work around problems with possibly
	  hostile programs, that try to detect DR-DOS to not run on this OS.
	Additional version check for 1072h kernels: At API level, there
	  is no known way to distinguish Novell DOS 7 from OpenDOS 7.01,
	  however, an IBMBIO.COM/IBMDOS.COM file date since 1997 and the
	  existance of an environment variable %OS%=OPENDOS usually indicates
	  an OpenDOS system (but not the other way around; some OpenDOS
	  BETAs still used %OS%=NWDOS!).
	Additional version checks for 1073h kernels: A functional test of
	  INT 21/AX=65A2h (see above for SHARE) can be used to distinguish
	  OpenDOS 7.02 BETA 1 from the later (OpenDOS 7.02 BETA 2+ and)
	  DR-OpenDOS 7.02 and DR-DOS 7.02 releases, which are both the
	  same, except for the name change and minor bug fixes. Testing
	  for the INT 21/AX=6601h/BX=0000h bug can be used to differentiate the
	  original release of DR-DOS 7.02 from later 7.02 updates and
	  DR-DOS 7.03.
	The DR DOS version is stored in the environment variable VER.

	  fix for "\\" in cmdline by Quick Basic 4.5/MS PDS 7.1 on Lantastic 4.0
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT303" English (1991-12-03, XDIR /C: 66B0h)
	  This patch makes INT 21/AH=4Eh (Search First) compatible with MS-DOS
	  when the Volume Label attribute is set. Previously under DR DOS the
	  volume label was only searched for if bit 3 was the only bit set in
	  the attribute whereas MS-DOS searches for the volume label if bit 3
	  is set, irrespective of any other bits in the attribute.
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT306" English (1991-12-11, XDIR /C: 8DE5h)
	  This patch fixes a problem with OPTASM which would give error 8
	  if there were not enough handles available. This patch forces the
	  system to check for available handles before it opens a file.
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT312" English (1992-01-07, XDIR /C: A0C6h)
	  This patch fixes a problem with INT 21/AH=26h (create PSP) the
	  segment from which the PSP was copied was incorrect so the the PSP
	  was not filled correctly and did not contain the command tail.
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT314" English (1992-01-10, XDIR /C: C964h)
	  This patch modifies INT 21/AX=33xxh, the Ctrl Break handler to
	  support undocumented MS-DOS function INT 21/AX=3302h.
	- DR DOS 6.0 BIOS patch "PAT315" English (1992-01-10, XDIR /C: DBAAh)
	  This patch fixes a problem where, when booting from a Bernoulli
	  drive, any DEVICE= statement in CONFIG.SYS failed if it was placed
	  after the device driver RCD.SYS v7.x and DOSOAD.SYS v1.x
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT317" English (1992-01-27, XDIR /C: B701h)
	  This patch fixes a problem where attempting to close a changed file
	  on a write protected disk seems to work after the first retry.
	  This was caused because when the retry is attempted the file has been
	  marked as not changed, so the attempt to write to disk is not made.
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT321" English (1992-02-19, XDIR /C: 947Bh)
	  This patch fixes a problem where the error codes returned from
	  INT 25h and INT 26h for "drive not ready" and "write protect"
	  errors were incorrect.
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT323" English (1992-02-20, XDIR /C: E1B0h)
	  This patch fixes a problem where, if the first command entered after
	  booting the machine is a single character, any use of the command
	  line recall keys will only recall the first command.
	- DR DOS 6.0 ??? German (1992-02-21)
	- DR DOS 6.0 update (02/1992)
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT326" English (1992-03-05, XDIR /C: 8EF2h)
	  This is an optional patch to prevent DRDOS from padding the
	  environment of EXEPACKed applications or utilities.
	- DR DOS 6.0 ??? German (1992-03-27)
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT334" English (1992-03-27, XDIR /C: 2AFEh)

	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "pat354" English (1992-07-28, XDIR /C: 3398h)
	  This patch for Beame and Whiteside Networks: On opening a duplicate
	  file handle which describes a device, a device open call is made to
	  inform the device driver that a new file handle has been opened.
	  This patch is current and up to date as of 1992-11-10.
	- DR DOS 6.0 update (07/1992)
	- DR DOS 6.0 BDOS patch "PAT301" English (1992-10-28, XDIR /C: 959Bh)
	  This patch fixes a problem with apps that opens a file, with Share
	  loaded, but then cannot delete the file until the file is closed.
	  This causes "Money Manager" to fail.
	- DR DOS 6.0 update (11/1992)
	Note: There is no known method to distinguish these different kernels
	       at runtime, except for - maybe - checksumming the IBMBIO.COM/
	       IBMDOS.COM files.
	      The listed patches only address a single problem, while the
	       listed updates are full rebuilds, also including all previous

	  (DR PalmDOS was the first DR DOS re-incarnation that supported
	  a genuine CDS, but still pretended to be DOS 3.31. Much of the
	  former CP/M stuff was stripped out to reduce the code size to meet
	  early Palmtop PC requirements. It introduced the patented dynamic
	  idle detection method (by Roger Gross), a special issue of the
	  TASKMAX program switcher (MINIMAX) to support Personal Information
	  Modules (PIM) plug-in executables, supported Flash/ROM disk,
	  XIP "Execute in Place" applications, and came with PCMCIA Card
	  Services and Service Stack (SS) partially written by Ian Cullimore
	  (ex-Poquet Computer Corporation founder).
	- DR DOS "Panther" BETA 1 (1992-10-16)
	  (This issue already supported DPMS, had the "Vladivar" pre-emptive
	  multitasker, DPMS-SuperStor disk compression, Multiuser-security
	  (World/Group/Owner), and much improved multi-windowing ViewMAX/3 GUI
	  which looked alot more like Windows than GEM. It pretended to be
	  PC DOS 5. However, this issue was never released and later partially
	  merged into the Novell DOS 7 project (without Multiuser-security and

Notes:	the segment used for the DR DOS 6.0 CONFIG environment variables
	  (excluding COMSPEC, VER and OS) is only useful for programs/drivers
	  called from CONFIG.SYS. The word is set to zero later when the area
	  is copied to the COMMAND.COM environment space.  This allows
	  CONFIG.SYS to pass information to AUTOEXEC.BAT.
	the Novell DOS 7 KEYB uses offsets 10h,14h, and 2Ch in the same was
	  as for DR DOS 6.0, so it is likely that the entire table is the same

Notes:	all of these entry points are indirected through this jump table
	  to allow the kernel to be relocated into high memory while leaving
	  the actual entry addresses in low memory for maximum compatibility
	some of these entry points (22h,23h,24h,2Eh,2Fh) are replaced as soon
	  as COMMAND.COM is loaded, and return immediately to the caller, some
	  returning an error code (the original handler for INT 2F returns
	  AL=03h [fail]).

Notes:	DOS 2.1-6.0 coalesces free blocks while scanning for a block to

	.COM programs are initially allocated the largest available memory
	  block, and should free some memory with AH=49h before attempting any

Notes:	apparently never returns an error 07h, despite official docs; DOS 2.1+

	    AX = error code (01h,02h,05h,08h,0Ah,0Bh) (see #01680 at AH=59h)
Notes:	DOS 2.x destroys all registers, including SS:SP
	under ROM-based DOS, if no disk path characters (colons or slashes)
	  are included in the program name, the name is searched for in the
	  ROM module headers (see #01595) before searching on disk
	for functions 00h and 01h, the calling process must ensure that there
	  is enough unallocated memory available; if necessary, by releasing
	  memory with AH=49h or AH=4Ah
	for function 01h, the AX value to be passed to the child program is put
	  on top of the child's stack
	for function 03h, DOS assumes that the overlay is being loaded into
	  memory allocated by the caller
	function 01h was undocumented prior to the release of DOS 5.0
	some versions (such as DR DOS 6.0) check the parameters and parameter
	  block and return an error if an invalid value (such as an offset of
	  FFFFh) is found
	background programs under European MS-DOS 4.0 must use the new
	  executable format
	this function ignores the filename extension, instead checking the
	  first two bytes of the file to determine whether there is a valid
	  .EXE header (see #01594); if not, the file is assumed to be in .COM
	  format.  If present, the file may be in any of several formats which
	  are extensions of the original .EXE format (see #01593)
	.COM-format executables begin running with the following register
	  values:
		AL = 00h if first FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		AH = 00h if second FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		CS,DS,ES,SS = PSP segment
		SP = offset of last word available in first 64K segment
		(note: AX is always 0000h under DESQview)
	old-format executables begin running with the following register
	  values:
		AL = 00h if first FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		AH = 00h if second FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		DS,ES = PSP segment
		SS:SP as defined in .EXE header
		(note: AX is always 0000h under DESQview)
	new executables begin running with the following register values
		AX = environment segment
		BX = offset of command tail in environment segment
		CX = size of automatic data segment (0000h = 64K)
		ES,BP = 0000h
		DS = automatic data segment
		SS:SP = initial stack
	  the command tail corresponds to an old executable's PSP:0081h and
	  following, except that the 0Dh is turned into a NUL (00h); new
	  format executables have no PSP
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, only function 00h is supported
	  and the pointers are passed in DS:EDX and ES:EBX
	DR DOS 6 always loads .EXE-format programs with no fixups and
	  .COM-format programs starting with 9Ch 55h (PUSHF/PUSH BP) above the
	  64K mark to avoid the EXEPACK bug, by extending the memory block
	  containing the program's environment; this code is disabled if the
	  name of the parent program as stored in the MCB is 'WIN'.
	DR DOS 3.41 and 5.0 check for a valid filename before testing the
	  subfunction number, so the otherwise invalid subfunction 02h will
	  only return error code 01h if the given filename actually exists;
	  otherwise, errors 02h, 03h, or 05h are returned
BUGS:	DOS 2.00 assumes that DS points at the current program's PSP
	Load Overlay (subfunction 03h) loads up to 512 bytes too many if the
	  file contains additional data after the actual overlay
	Load but Do Not Execute (subfunction 01h) is reported to corrupt the
	  top word of the caller's stack if the loaded module terminates with
	  INT 21/AH=4Ch in some versions of MS-DOS, including v5.00.

BUGS:	under DOS 3.x and 4.x, the second and subsequent calls to this function

		  "CHDIR" and "GETDIR" calls; normally set to 2 to hide the

	  DR DOS 5.0 uses other combinations for bits 15-12: 0111 JOIN,
	  0001 SUBST, 0101 ASSIGN (see #01644)
	Windows for Workgroups 3.11 network sets the path to the local
	  drive and directory even for network drives; in that case the
	  UNC form \\SERVER\SHARE can be obtained with INT 21/AX=5F02h
	  or INT 21/AX=5F46h. LapLink RemoteAccess does the same even for
	  INT 21/AX=5F02h
	Window NT 4.0 always uses X:\PATH, even for substituted drives (i.e.
	  the CDS will *not* contain the original path prior to SUBST)
	SoftWindows on the Macintosh PowerPC sets \\E for the host drive

	(DOS 3.0+) marks "no inherit" file handles as closed in child PSP
	this function is implemented using the same code as AH=26h, so unlike

Notes:	allows move between directories on same logical volume

	(DOS 2.x only) this function renames file by creating a new directory

	(DOS 3.0+) allows renaming of directories
	(DOS 3.1+) wildcards are allowed if invoked via AX=5D00h, in which case
	  error 12h (no more files) is returned on success, and both source and
	  destination specs must be canonical (as returned by AH=60h).
	  Wildcards in the destination are replaced by the corresponding char
	  of each source file being renamed.  Under DOS 3.x, the call will fail
	  if the destination wildcard is *.* or equivalent; under DR DOS 5.0,
	  the call will fail with error code 03h if any wildcards are used.
	  When invoked via AX=5D00h, only those files matching the attribute
	  mask in CL are renamed.
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the old-name pointer is in DS:EDX
	  and the new-name pointer is in ES:EDI (DS must equal ES)
BUG:	(DR DOS 3.41) when invoked via AX=5D00h, this function will generate

Desc:	creates a file with a unique name which must be explicitly deleted
Notes:	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the path pointer is in DS:EDX
	MS-DOS 3.0-4.0 and DR DOS 3.4-5.0 generate the filename as a sequence
	  of hex digits based on the current date and time; MS-DOS 6+,
	  DR DOS 6, and Novell DOS 7 use letters A-P in place of hex digits
	MS-DOS 5.0 and DR DOS 3.41/5.0 will insert a missing trailing backslash
	  before appending the generated filename, but due to this, an empty
	  string results in a file in the root directory
BUGS:	COMPAQ DOS 3.31 hangs if the pathname is at XXXXh:0000h; it apparently
	  wraps around to the end of the segment
	MS-DOS 5.00 revisions A and B and PC-DOS 5.00 revision A reportedly

Notes:	the Critical Error flag is used in conjunction with the InDOS flag
	  (see AH=34h) to determine when it is safe to enter DOS from a TSR
	setting CritErr flag allows use of functions 50h/51h from INT 28h under
	  DOS 2.x by forcing use of correct stack
	swapping the data area allows reentering DOS unless DOS is in a
	  critical section delimited by INT 2A/AH=80h and INT 2A/AH=81h,82h
	under DOS 4.0, AX=5D0Bh should be used instead of this function
	SHARE and other DOS utilities consult the byte at offset 04h in the

Return: DL = mode
	    00h redirected output is combined
	    01h redirected output in separate print jobs
Note:	MS-DOS and DR DOS 3.41/5.0 simply push AX on the stack and call

Notes:	MS-DOS and DR DOS 3.41/5.0 simply push AX on the stack and call
	  INT 2F/AX=1125h
	this function is also supported by 10Net, which calls it Terminate All

INT 21 - DOS 3.1+ - SET EXTENDED ERROR INFORMATION
	AX = 5D0Ah
	DS:DX -> 11-word DOS parameter list (see #01686)
Return: nothing.  next call to AH=59h will return values from fields AX,BX,CX,
	  DX,DI, and ES in corresponding registers
Notes:	documented for DOS 5+, but undocumented in earlier versions
	the MS-DOS Programmer's Reference incorrectly states that this call was
	  introduced in DOS 4, and fails to mention that the ERROR structure
	  passed to this function is a DOS parameter list.
BUGS:	DR DOS 3.41 and 5.0 read the value for ES from the DS field of the
	  DPL; fortunately, MS-DOS ignores the DS field, allowing a generic
	  routine which sets both DS and ES fields to the same value
	Novell DOS 7 (through at least Update 4) does not save the pointer,
	  which is always reported as 0000h:0000h by AH=59h; Update 15 fully
	  supports this function

INT 21 OU - DOS 4.x only - internal - GET DOS SWAPPABLE DATA AREAS
	AX = 5D0Bh
Return: CF set on error
	    AX = error code (see #01680)
	CF clear if successful
	    DS:SI -> swappable data area list (see #01689)
Notes:	copying and restoring the swappable data areas allows DOS to be
	  reentered unless it is in a critical section delimited by calls to
	  INT 2A/AH=80h and INT 2A/AH=81h,82h
	SHARE and other DOS utilities consult the byte at offset 04h in the
	  DOS data segment (see INT 2F/AX=1203h) to determine the SDA format
	  in use: 00h = DOS 3.x, 01h = DOS 4.0-6.0, other = error.
	DOS 5+ use the SDA format listed below, but revert back to the DOS 3.x
	  call for finding the SDA (see #01687); Novell DOS 7 does not support
	  this function, either.
