	    buffer filled with qualified name of form D:\PATH\FILE.EXT or
	      \\MACHINE\PATH\FILE.EXT
Desc:	determine the canonical name of the specified filename or path,
	  corresponding to the undocumented TRUENAME command in COMMAND.COM
Notes:	the input path need not actually exist
	letters are uppercased, forward slashes converted to backslashes,
	  asterisks converted to appropriate number of question marks, and
	  file and directory names are truncated to 8.3 if necessary.  (DR DOS
	  3.41 and 5.0 do not expand asterisks)
	'.' and '..' in the path are resolved
	filespecs on local drives always start with "d:", those on network
	  drives always start with "\\"
	if path string is on a JOINed drive, the returned name is the one that
	  would be needed if the drive were not JOINed; similarly for a
	  SUBSTed, ASSIGNed, or network drive letter.	Because of this, it is
	  possible to get a qualified name that is not legal under the current
	  combination of SUBSTs, ASSIGNs, JOINs, and network redirections
	under DOS 3.3 through 6.00, a device name is translated differently if
	  the device name does not have an explicit directory or the directory
	  is \DEV (relative directory DEV from the root directory works
	  correctly).  In these cases, the returned string consists of the
	  unchanged device name and extension appended to the string X:/
	  (forward slash instead of backward slash as in all other cases) where
	  X is the default or explicit drive letter.
	under MS-DOS 7.0, this call returns the short name for any
	  long-filename portions of the provided pathname or filename
	functions which take pathnames require canonical paths if invoked via
	  INT 21/AX=5D00h
	supported by OS/2 v1.1 compatibility box
	NetWare 2.1x does not support characters with the high bit set; early
	  versions of NetWare 386 support such characters except in this call.
	  In addition, NetWare returns error code 3 for the path "X:\"; one
	  should use "X:\." instead.
	Novell DOS 7 reportedly has difficulty with non-MS-DOS filenames on
	  network drives, and can return "D:" instead of "SERVER/VOLUME"
	for DOS 3.3-6.0, the input and output buffers may be the same, as the
	  canonicalized name is built in an internal buffer and copied to the
	  specified output buffer as the very last step
	for DR DOS 6.0, this function is not automatically called when on a
	  network.  Device drivers reportedly cannot make this call from their
	  INIT function.  Using the same pointer for both input and output
	  buffers is not supported in the April 1992 and earlier versions of
	  DR DOS
	Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Windows95 and even MS-DOS 7.00 only
	  return the local drive path; to obtain network paths use
	  INT 21/AX=5F02h or INT 21/AX=5F46h instead
	Corel's CORELCDX and MSCDEX without the /S switch return canonical
	  names of the form "\\D.\A.\path", where "D" is the CD-ROM drive
	  letter and "A" appears to indicate the first physical CD-ROM drive;
	  MSCDEX with the /S switch returns a canonical name with embedded
	  blanks.  Novell DOS 7 NWCDEX as of the 11/16/94 update returns the
	  same canonical path as MSCDEX; earlier revisions returned
	  "Cdex.   D:\path", where "D" is the CD-ROM drive letter
	the Windows95 MSCDEX-replacement VxD returns "D:\path", even though the
	  MS-DOS 7.00 MSCDEX behaves identically to older versions (above)
BUG:	Windows95 incorrectly treats filenames where the first two characters
	  after the drive letter and colon are both slashes (either forward
	  or backward) as a UNC (network name) and requires several seconds
	  to attempt to resolve the name before returning an unchanged
	  string

Notes:	not all code pages are available in all versions of DOS or
	  DOS-compatibles, and many (particularly EBCDIC) have not been
	  implemented for *any* DOS to date
	CECP = 'Country Extended CodePage' by IBM.
	Unicode (UCS-2) is a 16-bit character codeset, covering all commonly
	  used characters from almost any language. Not all definitions are
	  fixed at the time of this writing. Unicode will be the future of
	  character coding for the foreseeable future, but is only the
	  "basic multilingual plane" (BMP) subset of 32-bit ISO 10646 codes
	  (UCS-4), a single character set standard covering requirements for
	  all countries and languages, which is still under construction.
	The MS Windows 'ANSI' codepage 1252 (based on the MS Windows 3.0+
	  implementation) appears to be 100% compatible with the code sets
	  used by Amiga OS and Acorn Archimedes RISC-OS and is also a linear
	  subset of the 16bit UniCode code set (UCS-2); the actual ANSI
	  codepage is defined by ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1).
	At least applications for OS/2 Warp 3 Presentation Manager can use
	  EBCDIC codepages, but the codepage ID assignments for EBCDIC
	  codepages are not known for OS/2. OS/2 SAA codepages are not
	  supported in CONFIG.SYS.  Codepage 65400 "Glyphs" is not actually a
	  codepage, but a way to directly access the first 256 of the 383
	  glyphs from the current font set.
	Novell DOS 7/DR DOS 6/Caldera OpenDOS undocumented codepage 853
	  does not necessarily match with MS-DOS' undocumented codepage 853.
	Undocumented codepages 667 and 668 can be found in Russian's PTS/DOS
	  6.51 and S/DOS 1.x DISPLAY.CPI and contain some Eastern European
	  characters.
	Novell NetWare 3.xx clients support UniCode and codepages 437, 850,
	  860, 863, 865, 897, 932, and 1252 (possibly more). NetWare 4.xx
	  clients also support 1250, 1251, 1256. Personal NetWare 1.0 (PNW),
	  as it was distributed in Europe, supports UniCode and codepages 437,
	  850 and 1252.	 Novell's Client32 for DOS/Windows supports 874, 932,
	  936, 949, 950, 1250 - 1257. For codesets not yet available, Novell
	  offers a reduced ASCII 7-bit support through a codepage 0 used as a
	  translation table to UniCode, that supports characters 32-127 except
	  92 ('\').

Desc:	adjust the size of the per-process open file table, thus raising or
	  lowering the limit on the number of files the caller can open
	  simultaneously
Notes:	if BX <= 20, no action is taken if the handle limit has not yet been
	  increased, and the table is copied back into the PSP if the limit
	  is currently > 20 handles
	for file handle tables of > 20 handles, DOS 3.30 never reuses the
	  same memory block, even if the limit is being reduced; this can lead
	  to memory fragmentation as a new block is allocated and the existing
	  one freed
	only the first 20 handles are copied to child processes in DOS 3.3-6.0
	increasing the file handles here will not, in general, increase the
	  number of files that can be opened using the runtime library of a
	  high-level language such as C
	Novell DOS 7 reportedly terminates the calling program if the JFT is
	  being reduced in size and there are any open file handles beyond
	  the portion of the JFT being retained
BUGS:	the original release of DOS 3.30 allocates a full 64K for the handle
	  table on requests for an even number of handles
	DR DOS 3.41 and 5.0 will lose track of any open file handles beyond
	  the portion of the JFT retained after the call; MS-DOS will indicate
	  error 04h if any of the JFT entries to be removed are open

	  extended BPB on disk
	this function is supported under Novell NetWare versions 2.0A through
	  3.11; the returned serial number is the one a DIR would display,
	  the volume label is the NetWare volume label, and the file system
	  is set to "FAT16".
	this function is not supported by Novell DOS 7 through Update 13, but
	  Personal NetWare 1.0 and Update 15 do support this function
	the serial number is computed from the current date and time when the
	  disk is created; the first part is the sum of the seconds/hundredths
	  and month/day, the second part is the sum of the hours/minutes and
	  year
	the volume label which is read or set is the one stored in the extended
	  BPB on disks formatted with DOS 4.0+, rather than the special root

	Caldera's DPMS-enabled LONGNAME.EXE BETA 1 extension for DR-DOS 7
	  supports the following sub-set of LFN functions: 39h, 3Ah, 3Bh, 41h,

	  A0h, A1h, A8h. BETA 2 fixes LFN directory entry checksums, which
	  were causing wrong LFNs to be attached to a file. The 8.3 short
	  names for filenames with exactly 8 chars are no longer abbreviated
	  (e.g. LONGNAME.TXT -> LONGNAME.TXT, not LONGNA~1.TXT). BETA 3 has
	  A7h (BL=0, 1) functions added, and 4Eh/4Fh can return file times
	  in both DOS and 64 bit formats, BETA 4 has support added for
	  Caldera's DRFAT32 redirector extension (see INT 2F/AX=15xxh).
	Caldera's DR-OpenDOS 7.02+ COMMAND.COM utilizes the LFN API as soon
	  as it detects it (mind, that LONGNAME.EXE can be dynamically loaded
	  and unloaded at runtime). This COMMAND.COM shell also works under
	  MS-DOS/PC DOS and in DOS boxes of Windows9x, NT, 2000, and OS/2.
	For 4DOS 6.02+ to work with 3rd party LFN providers, the Win95LFN=Yes
	  directive should be inserted into the 4DOS.INI file.
	Mike Podanoffsky's RxDOS 7.2 provides most of this API natively,
	  including functions 39h, 3Ah, 3Bh, 41h, 43h (BL = ???), 47h, 4Bh,
	  4Eh, 4Fh, 56h, 60h (CL = 0, 1, 2, no CH), 6Ch, A0h, A1h and A7h.
