This is a sort of a guide to using the INT2WHLP precompiler. INT2WHLP
transfers Ralf Brown's Interrupt List to some RTF (Rich-Text Format) files
which can be used as input for Microsoft's HC31 WINHELP file compiler.

This text gives also some hints on using the the results of the compilation.


COMPILATION

The easy way to compile the list is this:

Change to the directory where you want your INTWIN.HLP file. There should
be at least 16 Mb free space on the disk. It can be the directory with the
Interrupt List files (which we will call the Source Directory), but it is
better to use a separate directory not to mess up the Source Directory. A
subdirectory under the Source Directory would be fine. Copy the following
files to the directory:
	INTWIN.BAT
	INT2WHLP.EXE
	INT2WHLP.CFG
	SHORTKEY.RTF (if program option -l- is used)
	FLT_METH.RTF (if program option -f<filter> is used)
	TABLEKWT.RTF (if program option -kt is used)
	SECKEY.DLL   (if program option -kt is used)
	SEL_TOPC.RTF
	MISC_INF.RTF
	I2W_HH.RTF
	HS_INIT.RTF
	INTWIN.PH    (see section COMPRESSION)
	INTERRUP.ICO (see section ICON)
	BAG.INI
It is handy also to have:
	I2W-FILE.TXT
	I2W-HINT.TXT (this file)
	I2W-CFG.TXT
	I2W-OPT.TXT
in the directory. For a partial compilation of the List, FLT_METH.RTF is
required (see paragraph FLT_METH.RTF in I2W-FILE.TXT).

Make sure that the following files are in the Source Directory:
	INTERRUP.LST or INTERRUP.A, INTERRUP.B, ...
	INTERRUP.1ST
	CATEGORY.KEY
	OVERVIEW.LST
	INTERRUP.PRI
	PORTS.LST
	MEMORY.LST
	CMOS.LST
	GLOSSARY.LST
where INTERRUP.LST is the concatenation of INTERRUP.A, INTERRUP.B, ... .

Make sure that HC31.EXE is somewhere on the DOS path.

Type
	INTWIN
       (INTWIN -R58 to compile a list prior to release 59 with 4-digit tables)
at the DOS prompt to start the compilation. On a 486/33MHz computer it
takes INT2WHLP 1 1/2 minut to precompile release 41 of the List, and it
takes HC31 40 minutes to create the INTWIN.HLP file.

Parameters to INTWIN will be passed to INT2WHLP, thus a compilation with
only the compressed interrupt index can be made with
	INTWIN -2-
This will reduce the size of the resulting help file from about 5 Mb to
about 4.85 Mb (release 44).

The configuration file in release 49+ disables the long version of interrupt
search keys, to reduce the number of keywords and enable keyword searching in
WinHelp version 4.00 (coming with Windows 95), which has a limited keyword
capacity. If you are using WinHelp 3.10 or 3.11, you can override the
disabling with
	INTWIN -L+

Version 1.20 of INT2WHLP published in release 56 includes a facility that can
conserve further space in the primary keyword table by moving table keywords
(#nnnn) to a secondary table. This facility will not be enabled until INTWIN
exceeds WinHelp's keyword capacity. In can, however, be invoked with
	INTWIN -KT
and it can be disabled if it is already invoked in the configuration file with
	INTWIN -KT-


PROBLEMS

It has happened that the Interrupt List was changed so INT2WHLP failed to
find aliases for some context strings. If this happens, a new INT2WHLP.CFG
file will be included in INTERnnZ.ZIP (see COMPRESSION). If other errors
occur during the compilation of the List, the README file in INTERnnZ.ZIP
will give hints about how to solve the problem.

November 1998: The authors will no longer compile all the interrupt list
releases, so you cannot expect immediate fixes and hints in a INTERnnZ.ZIP
file.


ERROR CODES

INT2WHLP returns errorlevel 240 - 245 if a fatal error occurs. It returns
errorlevel 1 if one or more warnings are issued (inconsistent Interrupt
List). The INTWIN batch file will let the user bail out (with ^C) if a
warning errorlevel was returned from INT2WHLP's compilation of the List.
It is recommended to terminate the batch file and fix the inconsistency in
the Interrupt List, and compile again.


CONFIGURATION

The INT2WHLP program lets you personalize your INTWIN.HLP file. If you use
high resolution graphics on a large screen, then read the comments in the
[CONFIG] section of the INT2WHLP.CFG file. For more details, see the files
I2W-CFG.TXT and I2W-OPT.TXT.


ICON

INT2WHLP will look for file INTERRUP.ICO in the following directories, and
in this order:
	The current directory (typically the user's own icon).
	INT2WHLP's home directory.
	The source directory (where INTERRUP.LST/INTERRUP.A ... resides)

If found, it will be included as an icon in the help file. It will then be
shown in Windows 3.1 when INTWIN.HLP is minimized. It will not have any
effect in Windows 95 (WinHelp v. 4.00.950). To use an interrup.ico icon to
identify intwin.hlp, it must be defined as the icon in the shortcut to
intwin.hlp.


COMPRESSION

The HC31 program supports three levels of compression: high, medium, and
none. Medium compressed and uncompressed files are about 15% and 100%
longer than highly compressed files, respectively. HC31 can use an existing
Phrases file (a .PH file with compression information), and it needs not to
be exactly up-to-date. Compiling release 41 with a PH file from release 40
gives a file about 4% longer than a compilation with an up-to-date PH file.

Compiling the compression information file is very resource consuming. For
Interrupt List release 41 compiled with INT2WHLP v. 1.10:
	631 kb < required DOS RAM < 730 kB
	27 Mb < required free disk space < 50 Mb
The compilation of the compression info took 20 minutes, and the rest of
the compilation took 40 minutes on a 486/33MHx computer. Actually, when
the computer gave up due to insufficient RAM when 631 kb were available,
it had already created an INTWIN.PH file that was identical to the final
file.

We will compile a Phrases file when a new list is released, and upload
it to SimTel a day or two after the release of the List in file
INTERnnZ.ZIP where nn is the List release number. See INTERRUP.1ST for
SimTel mirror sites.

November 1998: The authors will no longer supply an INTERnnZ.ZIP file.


HIGH RESOLUTION GRAPHICS

The default settings allow you to display the List on a normal 640x480 VGA
screen without the need of horizontal scroll. If you use high resolution
graphics on a large screen, you will want to define another size of the
secondary window used to display the tables, see comments in the [CONFIG]
section in file INT2WHLP.CFG.

The configuration file since Interrupt List release 56 changes the setting of
the setting of secondary help window used for tables for better compatibility
with 800x600 screens, and it can no longer be viewed on a 640x480 screen
without scrolling, unless the configuration file is edited.

If you use a high resolution graphics on a screen with small dimensions, you
might want to use a larger font. The file package I2W-TEST.ZIP contains files
that let you experiment with different fonts with very short INT2WHLP and
HC31 compilation times. Unzip the package to a subdirectory under your
INT2WHLP directory and read its README file.

Tools are availabe to edit the position and size of the table window in an
already compiled INTWIN.HLP file, e.g. WH_wEdit in the package WH_EDxxx.ZIP
(xxx >= 111) in SimTel directory simtelnet/win3/winhelp.


LIMITATIONS

DOS graphics characters where 176 <= code <= 223 are not converted to correct
Windows equivalents. Horizontal and vertical single and double framing
characters are converted to "-" and "|", and other graphics characters are
converted to "+".

INT2WHLP cannot handle more than 63 per line of other characters with code
> 126.


WINHELP VERSION 4.00 LIMITATIONS

Version 4.00 of Microsoft's WinHelp program (coming with Windows 95) has a
limited search index capacity. If the limit is exceeded, the search index
window is left blank. Ways to enable keyword searching in Windows 95:
	Complain to Microsoft about the limitaiton.
	Use program option -L- to disable long interrupt search keys.
	Reduce the number of extra files included in the compilation, or
	include them as type 1 files rather than type 2 files (ports.lst and
	memory.lst).
	Use version 3.10/3.11 of WinHelp.exe.


INTWIN's TOPIC SEARCH FACILITIES

INTWIN facilitates seaching interrupt topics with many different keys, based
on:
	a. Elements in the interrupt header line.
	b. Keys in the file CATEGORY.KEY for the appropriate interrupt
	   category.
	c. Combinations of interrupt number and register contents.
	d. Category letters.

For example,

--------D-215E01CH00-----------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 3.1+ network - SET MACHINE NAME
	AX = 5E01h
	CH = 00h undefine name (make it invalid)

will be listed with the following search keys:

	DOS 3.1+ network            \      a
	SET MACHINE NAME            /
	DOS kernal                  \ 
	kernal (DOS)                 >     b
	operating systems (DOS)     /
	INT 21 AX = 5E01 CH = 00 5) \
	INT 21 AX = 5E01         5)  \
	INT 21 AH = 5E           5)   \
	INT 21          1)       5)    \
	21 5E01 CH00                    \
	21 5E01                          > c
	21 5E           2)              /
	21              1)             /
	AX = 5E01                     /
	AH = 5E         3)           /
	CH = 00                     /
	D!              4)                 d

1) WINHELP lists only the first 400 search hits.
2) The short form of an interrupt using AL to specify a function has two
   leading dashes in the function number, e.g. the short form of
   INT 2D AL = 10 is 2D --10.
   Two dashes can be appended to the short form of an interrupt using AH for
   funtion number, to distinguish the string from the more general string
   used also as keyword for interrupts with the same value in the high part
   of the AX register, e.g. 10 00-- will give less search hits than 10 00.
3) Use AH = nn to search for functions called with nn in AH or in the high
   byte of AX. Use AX = nn-- to search for functions called with nn in AH and
   no specific value in AL.
4) Because WINHELP's search facility does not distinguish between letter case,
   the search keys for capital letter categories are the letter followed by
   an exclamation mark.
5) Program option -l- and configuration file key longKeys=0 disable the long
   interrupt search key.

TABLE CROSS-REFERENCES

Tables are separate topics in help files compiled with version 1.08+ of
INT2WHLP. When referenced from a "#nnnn" hotspot, the table pops up in a
secondary window, thus the user can easily change between the source in
the main help window and the referenced table in the secondary window.
However, secondary windows are less flexible than the main window: topics
are not recorded in the history list, you cannot browse between topics (<<
and >> pushbuttons), and the topics cannot be copied or printed from the
secondary window. Therefore all tables have a "Copy to Main" hotspot at the
top.

The table topic titles include the interrupt number and subfunction where
the table is defined, and there is a hotspot at the end of each table that
pops up the appropriate interrupt in the main window.

There are two search keys for each table topic: "#nnnn" where nnnn is the
four digit table number, and the table title as given in the Interrupt List
("Bitfields for ...", "Call ... with:", "Format of ...", "Values for ...").

If option -KT is used all the #nnnn keywords are moved to a secondary
keyword table and will not show up in the search dialog box. Use the key
"#Table Search" to open a new dialog box and enter the table number there.


FULL TEXT SEARCH FACILITIES

WinHelp's search facility offers search for predefined words or phrases.
Various utilities offer full text search in help files, i.e. search the help
file for any word or phrase the user specifies. These utilities are normally
implememted as one or more dynamic link library files (DLLs), and macros are
inserted in the help file to invoke the text search.

Oxford Computer Consultants include a special version of their FTS utility
in the Interrupt List. To use the facility, copy HINTSRCH.DLL from Oxford
Computer Consultants' program package HINTSRCH.ZIP to your Windows SYSTEM
directory. INT2WHLP's configuration file inserts the proper macros in
INTWIN.HLP. One of these macros inserts a "Find Text" pushbutton on
WinHelp's button bar. HINTSRCH.DLL works only with INTWIN, see material in
Oxford Computer Consultant's package for information about their products.

HINTSRCH.DLL is a 16 bits program, thus it is incompatible with Windows NT's
WinHlp32.exe program, see IntWin/Help and Hints/Windows NT Users.

Also Microsoft offers an FTS kit. Microsoft's kit uses an index file causing
the search to be extremely fast. A disadvantage is that it takes long time to
compile the index file, and it occupies much disk space (it is 70% longer
than INTWIN.HLP, 8.8 Mb vs. 5.2 Mb for Interrupt List release 45). For the
benefit of those who have access to Microsoft's FTS kit and want to use it,
INT2WHLP's configuration file inserts bag.ini as baggage in INTWIN.HLP, this
file is required by the kit. Utilities are available that can edit the macros
section of INTWIN.HLP to include the macros for Microsoft's kit (WH_wEdit,
see section HIGH RESOLUTION GRAPHICS). The baggage causes no harm if it is 
unused, and it occupies only about 100 bytes.

WinHelp under Windows 95 and Windows NT includes a full test search facility,
however, Oxford Computer Consultants' HINTSRCH has several advantages
compared to the built-in FTS. Most important, it lets the user step through
the hits within each topic, whereas WinHelp's facility takes you only to the
top of topics with hits.


HELP WINDOW PUSHBUTTONS

The Help Window includes some extra shortcut pushbuttons.

"Print" sends the current topic to the currently selected printer. To select
another printer, use "Print Select..." from the "File" menu.

"Copy" copies the current topic to the Cllipboard. To copy only part of the
topic, use "Copy..." from the "Edit" menu.

"Exit" closes both the main window and an open secodary (table) window.
Selecting "Close" from the control menu or pressing Alt F4 closes only the
main window.

"Print" and "Exit" are equivalent to selecting "Print Topic" and "Exit" from
the "File" menu.

"Find Text", see FULL TEXT SEARCH FACILITIES.
