May 31, 1994.

Christian and I have worked together on improving the Interrupt List to
WinHelp converter. This has made some of the information in INTWHLP1.TXT
obsolete.

The program name was changed from INTWHLP/RB2HLP to INT2WHLP.
The name of the WINHELP input file was changed from RB.HLP to INTWIN.HLP.
INTWHLP.DAT is no longer needed.
The INTWIN.PH compression information file (for HC31) included with release
41 is based on a 41á release of the Interrupt List, and it is recommended
to use high compression based on that file. See I2W-HINT.TXT.

The new version of INT2WHLP interprets a configuration file and the command
line for options, see the files I2W-CFG.TXT and I2W-OPT.TXT. See also
I2W-HINT.TXT.

Latest news: Ralf told that table numbering will be implemented in the
Interrupt List release 41. Because Christian is travelling around at the
moment, I have implemented a table cross-referencing which is useful, but
not ideal, because it is a reference to the interrupt where the table occur,
not to the table itself. I hope that release 42 of the List can bring a
version of INT2WHLP, where the tables are separate topics, with references
pointing directly to the tables.

As Christian has not approved this latest update, the source code will
not be included in release 41. It is the intension to include the source
in release 42 of the Interrupt List.
