 === Int2RTF Interrupt List Compiler v1.2 (C) 1996 Slava Gostrenko ===


     Introduction.

     This  program  converts Ralf Brown's Interrupt List into Rich Text Format
(.RTF)  file that may be further compiled with Microsoft Help Compiler such as
HC31.EXE or HCW.EXE to make Windows Help (.HLP) file.

     Int2RTF  uses  hypertext  features of the Interrupt List. It is the first
(and  the  only)  Interrupt  List  compiler that makes a real hypertext of the
Interrupt  List.  It  is  made  possible due to an advanced pattern processing
technique used in the compiler.

     Not  only it creates comprehensive indexes for all the topics in the list
but it also allows users to add their own indexes to the help file.


     Usage.

     Unpack  all the Interrupt List and Int2RTF files into one directory. Make
sure  that  there  is  at  least 18Mb of free space left on the drive. You may
need up to 23Mb of free space if you computer has less than 5Mb of RAM. Try to
free  up  to 5Mb of XMS memory (BIOS provided XMS suites as well as the memory
provided  by  himem  or any other XMS driver). The rest of the RAM may be used
for  disk  caching  provided  by any disk cache driver or operating system you
have.

     Note  that abovelisted requirements are derived for Int2RTF.EXE itself. I
don't  know  what  are the requirements for Microsoft Help Compiler. I usually
run HC31.EXE with 16Mb of RAM and more than 100Mb of free hard disk space. And
once  I've  got  a low memory error message running HC31.EXE with only 30Mb of
free  hard  disk  space.  But  it  happened  when I was trying to run HC31.EXE
without  preliminarily prepared key-phrase table (.PH file). I guess it should
run  Ok  with 30Mb of free hard disk space if you use key-phrase file supplied
with Int2RTF.

     Int2RTF  is  a  protected  mode (DPMI) program. So it is assumed that you
have  alredy  configured  RTM  (DPMI  Runtime  manager that comes with Borland
Pascal).  In fact the actual configuration (with the help of DPMIInst program)
is  required  if  you have a 286 class computer. Otherwise it is only required
that RTM.EXE and DPMI16BI.OVL can be found using PATH environment variable.

     Run  Int2HLP.Bat. After a while it will create IntWin.RTF file. Then this
file  will  be  passed  to  HC31.EXE  Microsoft Help Compiler. You should have
HC31.EXE and its related files reachable via PATH environment variable. If you
develop  under  windows you should already have Microsoft Help Compiler. It is
not  supplied within Int2RTF package. Microsoft Help Compiler is not nessesary
called  HC31.EXE. Int2RTF was tested witn HC31.EXE and HCW.EXE. It is HC31.EXE
that  is  called  from within Int2HLP.Bat. And Int2HLP_.Bat calls HCW.EXE. Use
Int2HLP_.Bat  if  you  have HCW.EXE. Edit Int2HLP.Bat or Int2HLP_.Bat if it is
your intention to use another version of Microsoft Help Compiler.

     Microsoft  Help  Compiler should produce IntWin.HLP that is the help file
you've been waiting for.

     Before  you  start  to use newly created help file please bother yourself
with   copying  of  HintSrch.DLL  supplied  with  Int2RTF  into  your  windows
directory.

     To use the help file in windows just double click on its name.

     IntWin.RTF  file  is  not  automaticly  deleted.  Delete it yourself when
finished with Microsoft Help Compiler.


     Note.

     Do not rename IntWin.HLP. HintSrch.DLL search engine will stop working if
used  not  with  the file named IntWin.HLP. And it does not work with the help
file  produced  by  HCW.EXE.  Use  Win95/WinNT  built-in help search engine to
search within help file produced by HCW.EXE.


     User defined idexes.

     To  define  your  own  index edit Int_Keys.Txt file. It is a list of user
defined  key  words  that  are  used  for  indexing.  Each word in the list is
searched  in  the  Interrupt  List topics. All the topics containing given key
word  will  be  listed  in  the  separate  index  topic. The key word used for
indexing will be the name of the topic.

     Int_Bold.Txt  file  is  the  list of the key words that will be displayed
using bold font. You may edit this file too.


     Technical notes.

     While  running Int2RTF creates 2 temporary files. Int2RTF.Swp is the main
swap  file  for  virtual memory. Topics.Swp is the swap file for the Interrupt
List  topics.  Temporary  files  are  deleted on the normal termination of the
program.

     The   Incomplt.Log  file  is  a  log  of  the  ambiguous  search  pattern
applications. Normaly you don't need this file.

     While  running Int2RTF displays it's current status and may display error
messages.  I've  debugged Int2RTF to run well on the Interrupt List Release 51
and  added  lots  of error checks to the program to make it easier to find the
incompatabilities  of  the  compiler's  algorithms  and  new  releases  of the
Interrupt  List.  So  let me know if you have a newer version of the Interrupt
List that is compiled with errors.
