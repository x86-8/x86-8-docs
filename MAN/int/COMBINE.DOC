			   COMBINE.COM v2.10
			     by Ralf Brown

COMBINE.COM will concatenate all of the partial files in the interrupt
list distribution archives into a single master file for interrupts and
a single master file for I/O ports, which is required by some viewers
and hypertext conversion programs.

To use COMBINE, just change to the directory into which you extracted
the distribution archives, and type

	COMBINE {dir}		(for interrupts)
   and then
	COMBINE -p {dir}	(for ports)

where {dir} is the name of the directory in which you want the combined
list to be stored (typically, you will type "COMBINE ." to store the
result in the same directory as the individual sections).  If there is
not enough free disk space to hold both the individual sections and the
combined list, you will be told and given the option of running COMBINE
again with an option to tell it that it should delete each section as
it is added to the combined file:

	COMBINE -d {dir}

COMBINE will skip any missing sections of the interrupt list; if at
least one section other than INTERRUP.A (PORTS.A with -p) is present,
it will stop as soon as the last section has been processed (otherwise,
it will continue trying all names through INTERRUP.Z/PORTS.Z).  On
completion, it sets the combined file's timestamp to be the same as
that of the last of the individual sections.

System Requirements:
	DOS 2.0+ or a DOS compatibility box
	64K available RAM
	a copy of the interrupt list :-)
	sufficient free disk space (~360K with the -d option)
